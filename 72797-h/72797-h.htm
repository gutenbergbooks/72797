<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE"><i>PREFACE</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> following account of life in Burma has
been written to make the country and its
people better known in America. At this time,
when the United States has come into possession
of large and important tropical lands, there is
much quickening of interest in all such countries.
Burma is much like the Philippine Islands
in climate, and there is great racial similarity between
the Burmese race and the Tagals.</p>

<p>But I have written chiefly to record the experiences
and observations of a missionary in a
great and important mission-field, which is not so
well known in the home land as it deserves to
be. My purpose has been to make the condition
of missionary life, and much of other life,
real to the reader, who has had no experience in
a tropical country. It is hoped that this presentation
of facts will add to missionary knowledge,
and secure a better acquaintance with the races
of Asia and the forces of civilization that are making
for the uplift of Asiatic peoples.</p>

<p>In writing of mission work in Burma, I have
given special prominence to that under the control
of the Methodist Episcopal Church. There has
been no printed account of this mission for the
twenty-two years of its history, and it seems well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
to give some permanent form to the record of
that which has been undertaken by our little band
of missionaries in that field.</p>

<p>In writing of races, social life, and government,
I have, of course, written of that which is seen
through a missionary’s eyes. It so happens that I
have had a great deal to do with people of various
nationalities, in relations not directly of a missionary
character. This has given me many opportunities
to observe as a man, regardless of my
calling. In all respects I have tried to be fair and
accurate. I have always cherished a fellow-feeling
with men whose labors brought them to Asia, and
my sympathies have been with all such in honorable
callings. It has been my purpose to reflect
the conditions of life with which they are surrounded.
There has been much excluded that I
would gladly have recorded, if the limit of this
book had allowed the additional facts. Some incompleteness
of statement has been unavoidable,
as I could not verify the details at the time and
place of writing. Ten years is a short time to study
great questions in the East, and to form conclusions
on the greatest of them; but I trust that
enough of well-digested facts has been told in
this book to give the student of missions and mission
lands an inside view of the questions discussed.
For such defects as are due to the limitations
of the author’s ability to gather or to present
facts in a satisfactory manner, I must trust
to the generous sentiments of the reader.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> Church of Jesus Christ has just closed its
first century of missionary effort within modern
times. The nineteenth century began with
only a few heroic spirits urging the Church to
awake to its responsibility of giving the gospel
to the Christless nations. The century has just
closed with a steadily increasing army of missionaries,
who are determined to give the gospel to
every man in his own tongue at the earliest possible
day, while the whole Church is beginning to
feel the missionary impulse, so far at least, that
an increasing multitude are eager to hear of mission
lands, the condition of the peoples without
Christ, the victories of the gospel, and to have
some share in its triumph.</p>

<p>Adoniram Judson, the great missionary hero,
enrolled the land of Burma in the list of great
mission-fields. He began his labors in Burma during
the second decade of the century. The following
pages are written as a report of missionary
labors and observations in that land in the closing
ten years of the century.</p>

<p>How the writer came to be a missionary, and
to be honored with an appointment to Burma, may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
warrant a brief statement. In almost all life’s important
steps, individual influence proves the determining
factor. This is true in my call to the
mission-field. In 1867, when only ten years of
age, living on my father’s farm in Andrew County,
Mo., I heard a Methodist preacher make a plea
for the heathen world. I have never been able to
recall his name, that being the only time he ever
preached in that place, which was a schoolhouse
on my father’s farm. The sermon made a profound
impression on me, and I decided to give half of my
little fortune of one dollar, saved from pennies,
to the cause of missions, with pleadings for which
he so warmed our hearts and moved our eyes to
tears. Later experiences have shown that missionary
sermon to have been the most potential
influence of my childhood or youth in determining
what I should be in after years. The experience
itself seemed to die away for a term of years,
due, I think, to the fact that I had little religious
training and no missionary information during
youth. The reawakening of missionary interest
came in 1880, when in college in the Iowa Wesleyan
University I heard William Taylor tell of
his missionary labors in many lands. Had I then
been near the close of my college course, instead
of at its beginning, I would have volunteered to
go to his mission in South America. Seven or
eight years went by, and I was in Garrett Biblical
Institute. At that time Bishop Thoburn delivered
a series of thrilling missionary addresses to
the school. I now think, though without being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
clearly conscious of it, that from that time I was
called to go to India. In 1889, I was pastor of
the Arlington Methodist Church in Kansas City,
Mo., and so became one of the entertainers of
the Missionary Committee that met in the city
that year. In listening to the missionary addresses
for ten days, and more especially in conversation
with Dr. Oldham, who was present, being commissioned
by Bishop Thoburn to secure re-enforcements
for India, the whole question whether my
wife and I should offer ourselves to the Missionary
Society for work in the foreign field came up
for final settlement. I sought the counsel of
Bishop Ninde, who had once been to India, and
whose kindly manner always invited confidences
of this sort. He agreed to come and spend a day
with us, two months later, which he did, and as a
result of his counsel and advice, we decided to
offer to go to India as missionaries. The offer
was promptly accepted, and from that time we
laid our plans to leave for our new field of work
the following fall. It has always been an inspiring
memory to recall the steps by which we were led
to let go of America and set our faces toward
Asia, and the personal agencies that led us to this
decision.</p>

<p>There was another consideration which had
great weight in our choice of the foreign mission-field.
At home there are men ready for all places.
In the foreign mission-fields, especially in Southern
Asia, to which we were drawn, there are several
places for every man. Here any one of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
dozen valuable men can be had for any important
charge. On the mission-fields there are most important
posts that call in vain for re-enforcements.
At home supplies can be had to meet any emergency
within a very short time; but on the mission-field
we often must wait years for the right
man. I left Kansas City in the morning, and my
successor, a very worthy and successful man, arrived
in the evening of the same day. But out in
Burma I have pleaded for years for one man to
re-enforce the mission. The Arlington Church,
which I was serving, was then and is now a very
enjoyable pastorate—one in which the people, always
cherish their pastor, and better, where they
have from the founding of the Church cordially
supported every effort for the salvation of men.
The decision to leave that Church to go half way
round the world to a people I had never seen, was
largely due to the fact that we were needed most
on this picket-line of missions, and good men,
who for any reason could not go to the foreign
fields, could be found to take up promptly the work
I laid down at home.</p>

<p>The farewells in Kansas City were of the
cheerful and happy kind that send missionaries on
their way to their peculiar missions strong in
heart. Arlington Church spoke its own farewell
in a reception to their pastor and his family, while
Grand Avenue Church, the Methodists of Kansas
City, followed with a general reception to the outgoing
missionaries. This general gathering was
under the direction of the pastor, Dr. Jesse Bowman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
Young, and Dr. O.&nbsp;M. Stewart, the presiding
elder. The latter sounded the note of cheerfulness
for the farewell. He said, “Let us have nothing
of a funeral sort about this reception.” We have
always thanked him for the cheerful and hopeful
tone which ran all through the meeting. Dr.
Young was of the same spirit, and in his address,
which at one moment bordered on the emotional
at the thought of a long parting from those to
whom he had been one of the best of friends, recovered
himself by saying, “If you discover anything
suspicious in my eyes, charge it up to the
hayfever.” These good brethren did more than
they knew to set a standard of joyful anticipation
on the part of the Church and the outgoing missionaries
in the honorable service to which they
were called, that toned up their courage when facing
the actual separation from home ties. This
was of very great value to us who were leaving a
very enjoyable pastorate, a native land in which
we had taken deep root, and most of all, an aged
father and mother.</p>

<p>We left Kansas City on September 3, 1890, and
after a little over two months spent in resting and
arranging our affairs, we sailed from New York
for Liverpool on November 12th. The closing
hours in New York were very different from those
in Kansas City, and made it appear very real to
us that we were being plucked up from the home
land and transplanted to a foreign country. We
had no acquaintances at all in New York, except
one of the Missionary Secretaries, who had visited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
us in Kansas City. He and his associates were
as kind as they could be; but then as now, they
were men worked beyond their strength with the
burdens of business there is upon them, and at
that particular time were hurried to get off to Boston,
to the annual Missionary Committee meeting,
and they had to tell us a hasty farewell at the
Mission Rooms, and leave us to go alone to the
ship. While our sailing was more lonely than that
of most missionaries, yet it is now the custom to
make very little out of the departure of men and
women to mission-fields, however distant. The
older missionaries contrast this formal dispatch
of recruits with the custom of forty years ago,
when men still in active service, were first sent
out. Then it was the plan to have the new missionaries
gathered in one or more churches, and
after speeches and exchange of good-will all
around, to send them forth with the feeling that
their outgoing on this great mission was a matter
of moment to the whole Church. It is presumable
that custom may change in this matter from
time to time, and especially as the number and
frequency of the departure of missionaries increase;
but it is certain that the departure of missionaries
to our distant fields on this, the highest
mission of the Church, can not be made less of
than it has been in recent years.</p>

<p>We sailed on the steamship <i>City of New York</i>,
the largest and swiftest ship then afloat. She
loosed her moorings at five o’clock in the morning
of November 12th. It was a gloomy morning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
with a cold rain, and though I was on deck to note
any objects of interest amidst the gloom, nothing
at all of importance was in view, save the Statue
of Liberty holding its light aloft in the harbor.
No departure from the shores of the home-land
could have been less cheering and romantic. But
as the great ship made her way out to sea, there
was a peculiar satisfaction in the feeling that came
over us, that we were actually on our way to
Burma. Some time before sailing, it had been
decided that we would go there, making headquarters
at Rangoon, the capital of that province
of the Indian Empire.</p>

<p>Our voyage across the Atlantic was uneventful
for the most part, but not uninteresting. On
a great ship one has a good opportunity to study
his fellow-passengers. One among our company
has since become an international character, and
even then had become widely known. This personage
was none other than Paul Kruger, President,
then and since, of the Transvaal Republic.
We then thought of Majuba Hill and its consequences,
but could not foresee that this son of the
African velt would, before ten years had passed,
throw so large a part of the world into turmoil and
lead in a great war. I was impressed with his
strong leonine features, and the less heroic fact
that he was one of the first among the passengers
to yield to the power of a rough sea.</p>

<p>Four days out we ran into a great storm that
lasted nearly two days. Up to that time we were
making a quick passage, but the wind and waves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
soon destroyed all hopes of making a high record.
The storm was worst at midnight, and as we were
being rolled until it was hardly possible to remain
in our berths, the ammonia pipes broke and flooded
the lower cabins with gas. Our cabin was located
near that part of the ship where the trouble occurred,
but no one was seriously injured. A similar
thing recently happened on the same ship in
a storm on the Atlantic, and again the suffocating
gas spread through the ship with one fatality and
a number of prostrations.</p>

<p>Landing at Liverpool, we went to London for
ten days, returning to the former place to take
the first ship direct for Rangoon. There are two
general routes from English ports to points in
India. By one you travel across the continent,
and usually take ship at some Mediterranean
port, and sail to Bombay. By the other you sail
via Gibraltar, and so go by sea all the way. Our
route was the latter course, and at the time we
went out there was only one line of steamers,
the Patrick Henderson, direct from English ports
to Rangoon. We took passage on a new vessel,
the steamship <i>Pegu</i>, making its third voyage.
“What a strange name for a ship!” we said. We
soon learned that the name was taken from an
old, ruined city of Burma, and that all the company’s
steamers bear the name of some city, ancient
or modern, in the land of Burma. So, at the
very docks, as we started Eastward, we met a
name suggestive of the ancient history of the land
of our future labors. In the appointments of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
the steamer we were much impressed with the
fact that we had no arrangement for heating the
vessel, but every plan for thorough ventilation.
We found it very cold on board until we passed
the Suez Canal. Otherwise the appointments
were every way satisfactory, and the fare reasonable.</p>

<p>This good ship made but one voyage more
under its Scotch ownership. It was then sold
to the Spaniards and renamed the <i>Alicante</i>. This
circumstance became of much interest to us at
a later date, when this ship was the first to be
loaded with defeated Spanish troops at Santiago.</p>

<p>The outward voyage had its many objects of
interest to the passengers going out for the first
time. We sailed in plain view of the Portuguese
and Spanish coasts, but were disappointed in passing
Gibraltar at night. The next day, however,
we were charmed with a magnificent view of the
Sierra Nevada Mountains in Southern Spain, as
they lifted their snowy heights into cloudless skies,
and their vineclad slopes dropped away to the
level of the sea. For nearly a whole day we sailed
close by the picturesque shores of Sardinia. Here
we noted a singular confusion of the compass by
reason of being magnetized by the land. As the
good ship swung off from the southern cape of
the island, it made two great curves to correct
the erratic state of the compass. We entered the
harbor of Naples in the full floodlight of a Mediterranean
noon. The afternoon was spent in the
city. Our party was not favorably impressed with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
the gay people in their holiday attire. It seems
they have many holidays of the like kind. In the
evening we sailed southward; and as darkness
closed around us, distant Vesuvius sent its fiery
glow upward on the black mass of overhanging
cloud, making a lurid night scene. In the morning
we woke in plain view of the great volcanic
cone of Stromboli, rising out of the sea. We were
near the island, which seems to have no land
except the volcano itself; yet houses nestle here
and there around its base. What a choice for a
home—at the base of an actual volcano! The
weather was perfect as we sailed through the
Straits of Messina, but great Mount Ætna, which
we hoped to see, was hid in clouds.</p>

<p>The second stop in our journey was at Port
Said. The Suez Canal is the gateway of the nations.
Port Said is its northern entrance. It is
under international control, and hence its government
is less responsible than that of almost
any other city. It is one of the most wicked cities
of the world. Representatives of all races are
congregated there. It is not our purpose to describe
this city, but to point out that here for the
first time we had a glimpse of the Orient. The
fellaheen of Egypt loaded our ship with coal,
carrying great baskets on their heads. We arrived
in the night, and the coaling began almost
immediately. My wife and I got out of our cabin
before day to go on deck and see these people at
work by the light of torches. A strange, weird
sight it was to Western eyes; and their shouting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
in strange tongues emphasized the fact that we
had indeed come to a strange land.</p>

<p>The Suez Canal is the natural dividing-line between
the Western and the Eastern civilizations,
between the cold Northlands and the perpetually
tropical countries of Southern Asia. Looking
westward and northward, you find energy put to
practical account; looking eastward, you find lethargy
and life no more aggressive that it must be
to keep peoples as they have been for a thousand
years. Westward you greet progress, but Eastward
life has been stagnated for ages, and only
stirs as it is acted upon from the West. Westward
you have an increasing degree of prosperity
and material comforts and advantages of modern
civilization, but Eastward you have such poverty
among the millions as can not be conceived by
people more favored. Westward you have civilizations
never content with present attainment;
but Eastward you have peoples whose highest
ideals are only to be and to do what their fathers
were and did before them. The West seeks to
produce new things, but the East condemns all
improvement for no other reason than that it is
new. All this, and much more, is suggested by
the Suez Canal, from which you plunge downward
into Asiatic civilization. Climatically you are
henceforth to know only the tropics, a climate,
so far as Southern Asia is concerned, that you
will come to know henceforth as dividing the year
into two seasons, “Three months very hot, and
nine months very much hotter.” At Port Said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
you will be informed of the change that is just
ahead of you. Whatever you may have bought
in New York or London, you will need one more
article of dress at Port Said—a helmet, to protect
your head from the tropical sun. You will never
see a day in Southern Asia in which you can go
forth in the noonday sun with an ordinary hat, or
without a helmet, except at your peril; and most
of the time you will wear that protection for your
head from early morning until five in the evening,
or later. You will have another indication that
you are going down into the tropics. If you
have made your journey, as we did, in the colder
months, the sunniest place on the deck has been
the most comfortable until you arrive at Port
Said; but there they raise double canvas over
the whole ship, and from that on, as long as you
go to and fro in the tropical seas, you will never
travel a league by sea that you do not have that
same double canvas above you when the sun is
in the heavens. No wonder the Suez Canal means
so much besides commerce or travel to all who
have passed through it to Southern Asia!</p>

<p>Through the fifteen hundred miles of the Red
Sea we took our way. Then the Gulf of Aden
was traversed, and next through the Arabian Sea
our good ship bore us on our journey. The heat,
like very hot summer at home, was upon us,
though we were out at sea in December. Coming
on deck one morning before other passengers
were astir, I was delighted to see the green hills
of Ceylon a few miles to our left. We had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
rounded the island in the night. The decks had
been scrubbed in the early morning, as usual; the
ocean was smooth, and the tropical sun flooded
sea and land, while the sweetest odor of spices
filled the air. At once I thought of “Ceylon’s
spicy breezes,” but I suddenly noted that the wind
was <em>toward the shore</em>, which lay some miles away,
and then I was prepared for the sentiment of the
chief steward who had sprinkled spices out of
the ship stores over the wet deck to please the
passengers’ sense of smell as they came forth to
give their morning greetings to this emerald isle
of the Indian Ocean. In rounding Ceylon we
reached our lowest latitude, six degrees north.
We were still six days’ sail from Burma, and our
course took us nearly northeast from this point.
The entire voyage from the Suez Canal to Burma
was made under cloudless skies and through calm
waters. A day from Rangoon we passed near
the beautiful little Cocoa Islands, while the Andamans
showed above the horizon far to the
southward. It is remarkable how much interest
there is among passengers when a ship is sighted,
or land appears on a long voyage. These Cocoa
Islands are important as being guides to vessels
homeward or outward bound, and they mark the
line between the Bay of Bengal and the Gulf of
Martahan. An important lighthouse has been
maintained there for the past fifty years. The
Andamans are shrouded in gloomy mystery, due
to the fact that they are used as a penal colony
of criminals transported from India. On the 31st<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
of December, 1890, after passing several light-ships,
we came, about noon, in sight of the low-lying
shores of Burma. We had been thirty-five
days from Liverpool, and were getting weary of
the sea, to say nothing of our curiosity to land in
a country new to us. But no land could be less
interesting than this shore-line of Burma, first
sighted on coming in from the sea. It lies just
above the sea-level, and besides a fringe of very
small shrubbery, and here and there a cocoanut
palm-tree, it is absolutely expressionless. After
lying at anchor for three hours at the mouth of
the Rangoon River, waiting for the incoming tide,
we began the last twenty miles of our journey up
the broad river to the city of Rangoon.</p>

<p>The passengers were made up mostly of people
who were returning to Burma after a furlough in
England. The anticipation of friendly greetings
and the appearance of every familiar object along
the river created a quiver of pleasant excitement
among them. Our missionary party were almost
the only ones who had not special friends in Rangoon
to meet them.</p>

<figure id="i_27" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 35em;">
  <img src="images/i_027.jpg" width="1843" height="1163" alt=" ">
    <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Sway Dagon Pagoda</span>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Presently all eyes were turned up the river as
the second officer called out, “There is the Great
Pagoda.” Yes, this, the greatest shrine of the
Buddhist world, rising from a little hilltop just
behind the main part of the city of Rangoon, lifted
its gilded and glistening form hundreds of feet
skyward. This is the first object of special importance
that is looked for by every traveler going
up the Rangoon River. It is seen before any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
public building comes into view. But presently
the smoke from the great chimneys of the large
rice mills of Rangoon appeared, and then the city
was outlined along a river frontage of two or
three miles. The city has no special attractions,
as viewed from the harbor; but the whole river
presents an animated scene, always interesting
even to any one familiar with it, but full of startling
surprises to the newcomer to the East. With
the single exception of Port Said, our missionary
party had seen nothing of Oriental life. The
panoramic view of that river and shore life seen
on that last day of 1890 will remain a lifetime in
the minds of our party. Steamers of many nations
and sailing-vessels under a score of flags,
native crafts of every description, steam launches
by the dozen, and half a thousand small native
boats of a Chinese pattern, called “sampans,”
moved swiftly about the river, while two or three
thousand people crowded the landing and the river
front. It is possible that half a hundred nationalities
were represented in that throng, but to us
strangers there were only two distinctions to be
made out clearly: a few men and women with
fair skins, and the remainder of the multitude
men of darker hue. “Europeans and natives” is
the general distinction used in all India.</p>

<p>Some incidents at such moments in our lives,
as our landing in this strange country, make profound
impressions far above their actual importance.
It was just six o’clock in the evening as
we made fast to the wharf. Suddenly, as I faced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
the new world life of labor just before me, and began
to contrast it with that of the past, I remembered
that just eleven years before, on that day
and at that hour, allowing for difference of latitude,
I stepped off the cars in a college town, and
parted with my old life as a farmer boy for the
new life of a college student. A great change
that proved to be, and this was destined to prove
even more in contrast with life hitherto. The
curious circumstance was that the two transitions
corresponded by the year and hour.</p>

<p>I awoke suddenly to the fact of great loneliness.
There were multitudes of people, but in
the whole company not a familiar face. There
were some whose names we had heard, and they
were ready to give us a cordial welcome as fellow-workers,
but we did not know them from all
the others in the throng in whose thoughts we had
no place. For myself, I have never had a more
lonely moment, even when unattended in the
Burma jungles or lost on the mountains at night.</p>

<p>Another incident, of a painful kind, occurred.
As I stood beside the ship’s doctor, who had been
coming and going to India for thirty years, he
volunteered information of the people who were
boarding the ship to greet expected friends. One
young lady passenger was greeted by her sister,
whose husband stood by her side. She was a
fair English lady; he was a tall, well-proportioned
man of good features, but he was very dark. The
doctor said: “That young lady is destined to a
great disappointment. Her sister is married to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
a Eurasian, and she, as an English girl, will have
no social recognition among English people here
because she has that Eurasian relationship.” To
my inquiries of interest, he said many things about
these people, in whose veins flow the blood of
European and Asiatic, concluding with the following
slander on these people, “They inherit the
vices of both Europeans and Asiatics and the
virtues of neither.” I refer to this expression
here to show how such unjust expressions fall
from careless tongues; for I have heard it scores
of times, breathing out unkind, even cruel injustice.
It is a slander that is not often rebuked
with the energy its injustice calls for. As I will
discuss this people in another chapter, I only say
here that for ten years I have been connected with
them, and while they have their weaknesses, this
charge against them is entirely groundless.</p>

<p>We were presently greeted by the small band
of Methodist missionaries and some of their
friends, and taken immediately to our Girls’ School
in the heart of the town. Here we rested in easy-chairs
of an uncouth pattern, but which we have
hundreds of times since had occasion to prove
capable of affording great comfort. While resting
and making the acquaintance of Miss Scott,
our hostess, an agent of the Woman’s Foreign
Missionary Society, I was impressed with several
features of our new surroundings. Though it was
New-Year’s Eve, the whole house was wide open,
and three sides of the sitting-room had open venetian
blinds instead of walls, to let in the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span></p>

<p>Then we were quickly conscious of the noise,
mostly of human voices, speaking or shouting
strange speech in every direction, which the
wooden open-plank house caught up much as
a violin does its sound, and multiplied without
transferring them into music. We came, by later
painful experiences, to know that one of the enemies
of nerves and the working force of the missionary
in Rangoon is the ceaseless noise from human
throats that seems inseparable from this Oriental
city. I have been in some other noisy cities,
but, as Bishop Thoburn once remarked, our location
in Rangoon was “the noisiest place in the world.”
Before these thoughts had taken full possession
of our minds, we were greeted by another surprise.
As we leaned back in the easy-chairs and
our eyes sought the high ceiling of the room,
there we saw small lizards moving about, sometimes
indeed stationary, but more often running
or making quick leaps as they caught sluggish
beetles or unsuspecting flies from the ceiling. We
counted nine of them in plain view, seemingly enjoying
themselves, unmindful of the presence of
the residents of the building or the nerves or tastes
of the new arrivals.</p>

<p>A watch-night service was held that night intended
for sailors and soldiers especially, to which
I went, while my wife remained and rested at the
school with our children. At the service I saw
for the first time what is so common in all like
gatherings in Eastern cities, the strange mingling
of all people who speak the English language.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
Being a seaport, the sailors from every European
land were present, and, so far as they can be secured,
attend this wholesome service, while the
soldiers from the garrison come in crowds, and
others interested in these meetings are there also.
Every shade of Eurasians was present. Some
of the people whom I saw that night for the first
time became my friends and co-laborers in the
Church and mission for the entire time of which
I write. Late that night, or in the earliest hour
of the new year, I fell asleep with my latest conscious
thought, “We are in Burma.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">We</span> were wakened early on January 1, 1891,
by the harsh cawing of a myriad of crows,
which roost in the shade-trees of the public streets
and private yards. We came afterwards to know
these annoying pests, that swarm over Rangoon
all day long, as a tribe of thieves full of all cunning
and audacity. The first exhibition of their
pilfering given us, was that first morning when
the early tea and toast, always brought to you
on rising in India, was passed into our room and
placed in reach of the children. The crows had
been perched on the window-sill before this, restlessly
watching us within the room. But on our
turning for a moment from the tray on which the
toast was placed, the crows swooped upon it, and
carried it off out of the window. This is but a
sample of the audacious annoyance suffered from
their beaks and claws continually. They are in
country places also, but not so plentifully as here
in the cities, where they literally swarm. Were it
to our purpose we could write pages of these
petty and cunning robberies of which they are
guilty. A very common sight is, when a coolie
is going through the streets with a basket of rice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
on his head, to see the crows swoop down and fill
their mouths with the rice, and be off again before
the man knows their intention, or has time even
to turn around. It must have been some such
sight as this in ancient Egypt, familiar to Pharaoh’s
baker, that caused him to dream of the birds eating
the bread out of the basket that he carried on
his head, and that foreshadowed the dire results
to himself. Those “birds” must have been “crows”
of the Rangoon species.</p>

<p>I could not wait long that first morning in Rangoon,
and the first of a new year, to get out into
the streets astir with human life. I took my first
impression of many specimens of humanity that
passed in view. While the common distinctions in
dress, complexion, manners, and occupations,
which mean so much when you come to know their
significance, were not recognized in this first view
of the people, I did get a very definite impression
of two classes—one well formed and well fed, and
the other class, those poor weaklings, mostly of
the depressed peoples of India, who migrate to
Burma. Of the latter, I wrote at the time to friends
in America, that they were specimens of the human
race that had about run their course, and must
die away from sheer weakness. Later conclusions
do not differ materially from this first decision.
But I did learn later that the fine-looking people of
strong physique were Burmese, and that the province
of Burma, generally, has very few peoples of
any race that compare in feebleness with some of
the immigrants from India that flock into the cities,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
such as Rangoon. It is chiefly what the traveler
sees in coast towns like Rangoon, which leads so
many transient passers-by to wrong conclusions
concerning Oriental countries. In Rangoon, many
other peoples are more in evidence than the Burmese.</p>

<p>After that early walk and breakfast, which came
about ten o’clock, the usual time, I met with Rev.
Mr. Warner, and took in charge the affairs of our
mission. It is a simple thing for a preacher to go
from one pastoral charge to another in America,
in every respect very much like the Church and
community he has always served; but it is entirely
different to go to a distant and unfamiliar country,
and take up work essentially different from anything
you ever had to do with before. Then, at
home it is the custom for each man to be occupied
with some one specific work and its obligations;
but on the mission-field, such as Burma has been
until now, there is such a variety of interests as
loads every missionary with the work that ought
to be distributed between two or three. That
morning I learned that we had an English Church
in Rangoon which supported its own pastor; an
English school that numbered nearly two hundred
pupils, and an Orphanage for the poor Eurasians
and Anglo-Indian children. There was also a work
among the seamen that visited the port. A woman’s
workshop had been founded some time before
for helping the poor Eurasian, and other
women, to earn a living with the needle. There
was also preaching going on among the Tamils and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
Telegus, some converts and a fair day-school being
conducted among them. This work was mostly in
Rangoon; but some preaching was done in the
villages round about, and one exhorter was holding
a little congregation of Tamils at Toungoo,
one hundred and sixty miles north from Rangoon.
A further account of Methodism will be given later,
and it is only necessary here to tell how the work
appeared to me that morning when I began my
labors in Burma.</p>

<figure id="i_37" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 29em;">
  <img src="images/i_037.jpg" width="1520" height="1162" alt=" ">
    <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Methodist Church, Rangoon</span>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We had a modest wooden church and also a
parsonage, a fair-sized building for the school, and
another of equal size for the Orphanage. Besides
these buildings, we had a couple of residence bungalows,
intended for rental for the support of the
Orphanage, but for which we were badly in debt.
Considering the small size of the mission, our debts
were large and troublesome. They were incurred
out of the emergencies of our work, and were not
the result of bad management in any way. These
debts were to be met at once, and added much to
my concern for the mission.</p>

<p>Another embarrassing feature of the finances
of the mission was found in this, that we had very
small missionary appropriations, and the time had
been not long before when our workers in Burma
had no money from home. The beginning of the
mission had been made entirely without funds from
America.</p>

<p>This was the more apparent when we look at
the distribution of the missionaries. I was to take
the pastorate of the English Church, and receive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
my salary from it; Miss Files, the principal of the
Girls’ High School, had never had any salary, except
what the school could pay her; Miss Scott,
principal of the Orphanage, had half salary; Miss
Perkins, the new missionary, alone had a salary
from the Woman’s Foreign Missionary Society.
Mr. Warner had less than full salary, though appointed
to native work. We had, also, a number
of teachers all paid locally, and supplies in the
mission-work, none of whom received a salary
from America. Here was an outline of a situation
in what was called a “self-supporting” mission-field.
How to pay debts, keep all this work going,
and make advance in mission operations with our
limited money, was my greatest responsibility.
There had never been a dollar given to the mission
from America for property. The problem was easy
of statement, but difficult of solution. To plunge
right into this work, my first day in the country,
and immediately become the responsible head of
the district, was beginning mission-work with vigor
and without delay. I have learned since to believe
it a serious misfortune that any missionary should
be so overwhelmed with work and responsibility
on entering a foreign mission-field. All this, too,
when we had yet to adjust ourselves to life in the
tropics.</p>

<p>We were about to prove what it meant to be
suddenly dropped down into the heart of an Oriental
city, and there adjust ourselves to the most trying
conditions we had ever known. The parsonage
belonging to the English Church, which we occupied,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
shared the lot with the church building. At
the time the church and parsonage was to be built,
it was the policy of the Government to give a
grant of land to any religious society for a church
or parsonage. The city is blocked out in rectangular
shape, but unwisely made very narrow
and long. The blocks are eight hundred feet long
by one hundred and fifteen feet wide. Our lot
included one end of a block, and was one hundred
feet deep. On this lot stood the church and parsonage,
facing the main street. When the location
was chosen, it was a fairly satisfactory site on which
to have a residence, and in a Western country,
with Western conditions, it might have contained a
fairly comfortable residence; but in Rangoon the
natives soon began to crowd into poorly constructed
buildings all around the parsonage, and
the filth, that so rapidly accumulates in an Oriental
city, piled up everywhere. The only sewerage was
in open ditches that ran on three sides of our residence.
The stench of these sewers was ever present
in our nostrils, and especially offensive in the
rainless season. But the worst condition was the
incessant noise made by the natives. This neighborhood
was occupied almost entirely by Madassis,
who have harsh, strident voices, and speak with a
succession of guttural sounds. They are always
shouting, and quietness is almost unknown to them.
They quarrel incessantly. At the time we lived in
this locality there were six hundred of these noisy
people living within a hundred yards of the parsonage.
They kept no hours for rest. All day and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
all night the noise went on. Sometimes, of course,
they slept, and the native can sleep in bedlam and
not even dream. But there are hundreds astir at
all hours of the day and night. Then there were
thousands of passers-by who at all hours added
their voices to the din. Besides, a heavy traffic
was carried on on two sides of us. The streets
were metaled, and every wheel and hoof added to
the uproar.</p>

<p>The parsonage was of the uncouth architectural
plan characteristic of Burma, roomy and arranged
well enough for comfort in that country, had the
surroundings been endurable. But being placed
upon posts, some ten feet from the ground to the
first floor, and the floor and walls being made of
single thicknesses of teak planks, these multitudinous
sounds of the neighborhood were gathered
up and multiplied as a violin gathers the sounds of
the strings, and this discordant din was poured
into our ears. Added to all this noise was the
intense heat, which even in the coolest part of the
year is very great, and you have conditions of life
that tax you to the utmost. My wife and I have
pretty steady nerves; but in the thirteen months
we tried to live in the parsonage we did not have
more than twenty nights of unbroken sleep. Just
after we entered this residence, we received our
first mail from home, and in the papers to hand
we read the speech of the senior missionary secretary
at the Missionary Committee meeting in
Boston, held at the time we were sailing from New
York, in which he dwelt at length, “on the luxury<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
of missionary life in India.” I promptly sent him
an invitation to spend the last week preceding the
next Missionary Committee meeting in our guest-chamber,
overlooking and overhearing all that
happens among this noisy throng of Tamils. I
felt that I had learned more of the actual conditions
of life in an Oriental city in one week, than this
good man had learned in all the years of his missionary
official life. He did not accept the invitation.</p>

<p>When one is overworked with unusual duties
that tax nerves to the utmost, and then lives in
perpetual noise and heat day and night, he has
the ideal conditions for a short missionary career.
We were to prove all that this meant within one
year from landing in the country.</p>

<p>Surprises and disappointments in the working
force of a mission, at least in its earlier and less
well organized state, occur with great frequency.
Within less than three months, my missionary colleague,
Mr. Warner, and his wife left us, and took
work in another mission. He had been with our
mission less than two years, having been sent out
from America. It may be said here that such
changes, so early in a missionary’s career, do not
generally argue well for the stability of purpose or
settled convictions of the missionary, and do not
usually help the mission to which a change is made.
But in our case it added to our difficulties, as the
Burmese work, to begin which Mr. Warner was
appointed, did not get started for some years
afterward. There was no other man to take up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
his work, and there could be no one supplied for
some time. This situation, coming so soon after
I took up the work with the high hopes of a new
beginner, added to the complications.</p>

<p>The heat increased from January onward. The
work became very laborious, largely owing to failure
to get rest at night. In May, I began to be
troubled with a strange numbness in my arms.
This gradually spread to most of the muscles
of the body, and began to affect my head seriously.
At the same time, the heat, especially
any direct ray of the sun, caused very distressing
nervous symptoms. Having all my life worked
hard, and having a body that had stood almost all
kinds of strain and seemed none the worse for it,
I at the beginning expected to throw off these
symptoms quickly. But when I did not succeed
in this, I consulted physicians and found that they
were puzzled as much as myself. Had it been possible
to go to some cooler place and take rest at
the beginning of this disorder, it is likely that I
could have met the difficulty and overcome it
quickly; but there was no chance to leave the work,
no place to go to, and no one to relieve me.
Steadily for five months the trouble increased, until
it was impossible even to read in an attentive way,
though under the excitement of a Sabbath’s congregation
I could talk to the people. In October,
only a little over nine months after landing in
Burma, Bishop Thoburn peremptorily ordered me
to the hills of India for a change. He temporarily
supplied my place at Rangoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span></p>

<p>I left Rangoon on the evening of the 10th of
October on this painful flight for health. My wife
remained and did hard service, all too hard as the
case proved, to give the English congregations
attention during my absence. This early flight
from my work with the uncertainties of my ailment,
and the long distance to the Indian Hills,
which as we supposed at the time, was the nearest
place to get above the heat of the plains, and the
condition of the work in my absence, and the added
burden to my wife, all combined to give the occasion
a serious aspect.</p>

<p>I took passage on a little vessel of the British
India Steam Navigation Company, which has a
large fleet of steamers in these tropical waters. I
traveled after this many times on steamers of this
company, and always found the trip of four days
to Calcutta very interesting. The sea breeze modifies
the heat until you can be in comparative comfort.
The officers are usually courteous, but somewhat
reserved, for the most part. Perhaps this
show of dignity is assumed to support the important
office they hold. It may be that it is a National
characteristic also. The engineers, who number
about the same on each ship as the officers, and
have about as much responsibility, and are equally
capable men, are usually very free and sociable.
The officers are generally Englishmen, and the
engineers Scotchmen. I have been greatly surprised
to find how approachable most Scotchmen
are. Being of a social disposition myself, I usually
get in touch with both classes; but I have secured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
the most friendly response from the Scotch. This
has been generally true on land also.</p>

<p>The Bay of Bengal is a stormy water during
the monsoon, from May until October. At the
latter time the wind turns into the northeast, and
one or two cyclones generally form as it turns
the rain currents back to the southwest, from
whence they came. Our captain was nervous as
we rounded the land and made for the open sea,
lest we be met by a cyclone. But instead of a
storm, the sea was as smooth as a sea of glass all
the way to the mouth of the Hoogli River, where
we enter the last portion of our voyage. It may
not have been noticed that many great seaports
are really a great way from the sea, on rivers.
More than that, they are usually not on the main
stream, but on some subordinate branch of the
many mouths of the great rivers. So it is with the
Hoogli, which is not the largest of the many
mouths of the Ganges. These river mouths, however,
are very large streams, partly made by the
inflow and outflow of the tides. The tides alone
make navigation to Calcutta by ocean-going vessels
possible, as there is not enough water on the
shoals except with high tide. Calcutta is up the
Hoogli River one hundred and twenty miles. One
naturally wonders why such a city is so far from
the sea. I, at least, have had to content myself
without a reason, and like many things Indian,
accept that “which is,” and that “which remains as
it is,” because it “has been.” The approach to
Calcutta by river is very dangerous. The number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
of ships that have sunk, often with some of the
passengers and crew, make a startling history of
tragedy. Some places on the river have permanent
names for the sunken ships that are buried in its
sands. The currents and the tides conflict often,
and drive the vessel onto some newly-made bar,
and this overturns the great ship, which immediately
begins to sink. Three ships have gone down
in this river in ten years, one of them with much
loss of life. After the vessel sinks well into the
sand it rights up again, and lifts its masts out of
the water, to remain for years a solemn monument
to the tragedy of the river. Usually all life-boats
are swung loose and the ports all closed as the ship
moves up or down the river at these most dangerous
parts. There are specially-qualified pilots,
highly paid, who take ships through this river, and
they are held to the severest account. An accident,
whether the pilot is to blame or not, calls for
heavy penalties.</p>

<p>The river has its charming scenery. The country
is flat; but the quaint conical Bengali houses
that line the shore, with their carefully-laid thatch
roofs, the cocoanut and date palms growing in
great luxuriance on the alluvial deposit of the river
front, and the wide reaches of the rich rice-fields,
through which the winding river makes its way,
all present a picture of rare tropical interest and
beauty.</p>

<p>Villages increase as you approach the city, and
great oil refineries and weaving establishments and
manufactories increase as you near the city. Some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
miles below the city the traveler begins to see a
great many ships, both sailing vessels and steamers,
and as he enters the harbor it is amidst a very
forest of towering masts. The shipping that goes
in and out of Calcutta, carrying every flag under
heaven, is enormous.</p>

<p>I was greatly interested in seeing for the first
time this most important city in Southern Asia, if
not in all the Orient. My stay was too brief to get
a fair view of the city, but enough to see that it
is as reported, “a city of palaces.” It is also a
“city of hovels,” in which multitudes of people do
business and live in as great contrast to the palatial
surroundings, as can be found anywhere on the
face of the earth.</p>

<p>After a very brief visit with Bishop Thoburn
and other Calcutta missionaries, I made my way
up country. This took me over the fertile plains
of Bengal, through the sacred city of Benares,
though without a stop until I reached Lucknow.
Here I had a short rest, and then proceeded to
Bareilly and was the guest for a day of Dr. and
Mrs. Scott, and visited our theological school. In
this visit I began an acquaintance with our missionaries
and our mission interests in these great
centers, which has extended through the years with
great profit to myself, and an enlargement of view
of our Southern Asiatic missions, that I could not
have otherwise had. The heat of North India is
much modified by October; but as I was making
for the mountains, with a feverish desire to get
where it was cool, I pushed on rapidly. The railway<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
journey ended at Katgodam, from whence I
was to take a pony and go by marches to Almora,
the capital of Garwal, four ordinary days’ travel
into the hills. All over the Indian Empire the
Government has built on every road public rest-houses,
where the traveler can get shelter, and
usually food, at a very reasonable price. I had
only the afternoon to climb the eight miles to Bhim
Tal, my first stage of the journey. I traveled with
light equipment; but in all parts of India one must
carry his bedding with him, even if he is going to
an Annual Conference. “Entertainment” among
friends means many good things, but seldom includes
bedding, much less so among strangers. I
secured a pony to ride; but when it came to the
bedding I had to hire a coolie to carry that. I had
great difficulty in getting a coolie to go four days’
march back into the mountains. I could not speak
a word of the language, and this was a hindrance.
I found a friendly native who could talk for me.
I secured a strong man for <em>four cents a day</em>. This
was an enhanced price exacted because I was a
stranger.</p>

<p>I went steadily up the mountains, and with
every degree of cooler air I felt cheered. At last
at beautiful Bhim Tal, a lake at an elevation of
perhaps five thousand feet, I came to the bungalow
and had a good supper. Bedtime came, and
still the coolie did not come. I had to borrow some
blankets of a native and lay down, but not to sleep,
as any one accustomed to the country could have
foretold. My coolie did not arrive until sunrise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span></p>

<p>During that day I had a view of the majestic
mountains, that lives with me still. At about ten
o’clock in the morning, after an inspiring climb
up and still up, I came to the mountain pass, and
turning a corner, the great snowy range of the
Himalaya Mountains rose into a cloudless sky.
The sunlight was reflected from the snow up into
the blue heavens. Sublime are these mountains!
Three peaks near together range between twenty-two
thousand and twenty-five thousand feet, while
the snowy range is visible for hundreds of miles.
It was a great experience. Having never been
among the mountains until that journey, and then
to have eyes, mountain hungry, feast of these piles
of majestic heights, thrilled me as no view of nature
ever has done. I have seen many beauties of natural
scenery, and some of nature’s sublimity, but
never have I seen the equal of that view that burst
on my enraptured vision that glorious October day.</p>

<p>Making a double march the third day, I arrived
at the Almora Sanitarium of the Methodist
Mission, and was welcomed by Dr. and Mrs. Badley,
who were there, the last of those who had gone
up for rest that year. The doctor was fast breathing
out his life. He was dying of consumption,
but working until the last. He was busy revising
his Indian Mission Directory. His voice was gone
to a whisper, and yet he worked. I helped him
as I could, and looked into his face and tried to
realize the thoughts of a man who loves work, and
in the midst of a most successful career he is cut
down, and knows in every moment of waking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
thought that he can live but a few days. Ten days
I staid there, and then came down the mountain
road to Katgodam. On this journey I did my last
service for the sick and dying man. At Katgodam
I carried him in my arms and laid him on his bed
in the car. The gentle caress from his wasted
hand, and his whispered blessing for the help I
had been to him on the hard journey, linger as a
precious memory. He died three weeks later.</p>

<p>From Katgodam I returned to the hills, but
this time only to Naini Tal, one day’s march up the
mountains. In this wonderful hill station I remained
ten days, the guest of Rev. and Mrs. Homer
Stuntz. November had come, and by this season
it was getting cool in these mountains, frosting
some at night. I here received a great encouragement
in the matter of health, as I found while living
in this cool atmosphere that my head began to
clear up, and that I could read with pleasure again.
Had I been able to remain there, it is possible that
I would have made a rapid recovery; but duty
seemed to call me again to Rangoon. Dr. George
Petecost was then engaged in a series of “missions”
in India, and I had secured the agreement
of several Rangoon ministers and missionaries to
invite him to hold a mission in Rangoon. He was
due there in December, and it was nearing the end
of November; and as I felt better, and as I was
obligated to be in Rangoon, and as the worst heat
of the latter place had gone, I hoped to continue
to improve, even if I returned. But I was quickly
undeceived. No sooner was I in the plains than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
all the distressing symptoms again appeared. This
condition was relieved a little when I crossed the
Bay of Bengal, but increased on landing in Rangoon.
Meantime, my wife had broken down under
the strain of her work, and was seriously ill. So
ended our first year in Burma—much hard work,
trying conditions, and breaking health. Had this
been all the outlook, it would have been disappointing
indeed. But the people of Rangoon had been
responsive and kind. The work in the English
Church had gone forward and some conversions
had resulted, which had been of permanent worth
to the Church. The lady missionaries had completed
a successful year in the school and Orphanage.
The other branches of the mission were
faithfully cared for, so far as the limited supervision
given would warrant.</p>

<p>At this time, and indeed for the whole period
of which I write, Burma had been a district of the
Bengal Conference, and as the sessions of Conference
were held almost uniformly in Calcutta
or some Indian station, we Burma missionaries
usually made the trip to India to attend the annual
session. This took me, including health trips,
thirty times over the Bay of Bengal in the ten
years of my missionary service. The Indian Conferences
have for many years been held as near the
beginning of the new year as may be. I left my
wife very sick, and started for Conference about
the middle of January, being far from well myself,
but still at work. The Annual Conference was of
great interest, and the Central Conference, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
followed immediately, even more so. I was a member
of the Central Conference also. The Central
Conference of India and Malaysia had been well
organized for several years. This body, to all intents
and purposes, is a General Conference. It
is an increasing power for good. It must exist to
keep Methodism in this wide area in some organic
unity. It has served this purpose admirably. At
this session of the Central Conference, held at Calcutta,
in January, 1892, two great questions had
a clearly-defined statement that has become of
wide-reaching importance.</p>

<p>The question of territorial divisions came up
early, and had the right of way for full discussion
and settlement. Our people at home can not understand
the great areas, as well as the many millions
of people in Southern Asiatic mission lands.
It is all so much bigger than the notion given by
a map. At the time of which I write we had three
Conferences and the far-away mission of Malaysia.
The most extensive area was included in the Bengal
Conference. One end of this Conference included
the province of Burma, and the other end
reached up to and included almost all the Northwest
Indian part of our mission. Thus it curved
all around the southern and western sides of the
North India Conference, as far as Mussoorie. In
length it could not be less than two thousand miles.
South India Conference included territory equally
incongruous with its name. It became apparent
that we must divide up this territory, and make
more Conferences. We planned five Annual Conferences,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
and raised Malaysia to a Mission Conference.</p>

<p>The other great question that had the earnest
consideration of the Central Conference was the
indorsement of the Missionary Episcopacy. Some
of the Annual Conferences had already taken
action, and the Central Conference approved the
resolutions of the Bengal Conference indorsing and
approving the Missionary Episcopacy, and asking
its continuance as contrasted with the General
Superintendency. Bishop Thoburn’s administration
received, after careful debate, the first of that
series of indorsements that has lifted the Missionary
Episcopacy into a new and conspicuous place
in the organism called Methodism.</p>

<p>These two transactions made that, my first,
Central Conference of India and Malaysia, memorable.</p>

<span class="subhead">A Year of Changes</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">While</span> still at Conference at Calcutta, I received
a telegram to hasten home, as my
wife was seriously ill. Some of the brethren and
I spent a season in sympathetic counsel over this
distressing situation of my own impaired health,
and the serious condition of my wife. I took a
steamer the next day, and started for Rangoon.
Of course, we wished for a rapid passage; but as
often happens when we are eager for the most
rapid advance, there proves to be the greatest
delay. We were delayed in the Calcutta River
forty-eight hours, owing to fogs settling down on
the water just as the tide was favorable for sailing.
We had to tie up for such time as the fog
lasted, as no steamer will move on that dangerous
river in a fog. When the fog did lift, the tide had
gone down, and we had to remain at anchor till
the next tide. In all my journeying up and down
the river, I have never had so much delay as on
this voyage, when I wanted to get forward the most
urgently. The journey across the bay was after
the usual sort. I felt much distressed about my
wife’s state, but had great comfort in the sympathy
and counsel of Dr. and Mrs. Parker, who were fellow-passengers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
going home on furlough. They
were going via Rangoon, and it proved a kindly
providence as they did good service in advising
us in our time of need.</p>

<p>As our ship approached the Rangoon River, we
were again just too late for the incoming tide,
causing another long delay. So near home, and
yet we had to lie there for twelve hours! When
we finally arrived in the Rangoon Harbor, it was
after the longest voyage that I have known upon
the bay. But I was immensely relieved to find
that my wife was slightly better. This was offset
somewhat by the fact that I was certainly in a
much less satisfactory condition than I had been
for some weeks preceding. It was now early in
February, and the heat was becoming severe. As
the heat was, or appeared to be, my greatest drawback,
and would hinder the recovery of my wife,
it was decided that the only solution of the difficulty
was to make another flight to the Indian
Hills immediately for a long rest. This time the
whole family was to go. Here also Dr. Parker’s
presence and counsel were of great value. He knew
India, having had long experience and the best
judgment, so we felt safe in following his advice.
He had selected two of the Indian hill sanitariums,
and knew that that kind of a retreat was my only
hope. But he, and every one else at this time,
supposed that my work in Burma was ended. It
was decided to ask for some one from home to
relieve me as soon as possible.</p>

<p>But there was the immediate difficulty of looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
after the work, and especially the English congregation.
The Conference that had closed so
recently had appointed a young man, J.&nbsp;T. Robertson,
to be my assistant in the Rangoon English
Church, so that I could give more time to the
affairs of the district. He was only a probationer
in the Conference, having been admitted to Conference
at its recent session, and he had had no
experience as a pastor. More, he had come to a
strange city; but, as the case often is in our mission
work, we had to take all the risks to the work
and to the man, and appoint him to the untried
responsibility of the pastorate of the English
Church. That he would have run away if he could
have gotten out of the province he has often declared;
but this being impossible, he went to work
with a will, and for the next five months did very
acceptable service as pastor.</p>

<p>Such adjustment of mission work was made
as could be in the five days that intervened after
my return from Conference and our second departure
from Burma. I hoped to aid the workers
somewhat by correspondence. The journey across
the water began to revive Mrs. Smith, and her condition
on arrival at Calcutta was greatly improved.
Here we sought the best medical advice. Dr.
Coates, a famous Calcutta physician for many
years, gave us his counsel. He predicted that Mrs.
Smith would continue to improve rapidly, which
she did. As for myself, he said that the difficulty
was very obscure, and very difficult to deal with.
He said that if I went to the hill station of Mussoorie,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
where we were intending to go, it would
be the very best thing I could do. He further predicted
that if I did not get better there in four
months, I would never get better in India. He
stipulated “four months,” as that would take us
through the rainless hot season. If this time were
spent in Mussoorie, situated as it is at an elevation
of seven thousand feet in its cool and bracing air,
it would be the best possible place for recuperation.
After resting some with friends by the way,
we arrived in that hill station on the 13th of March.
The snow was still in sight in some lower hills, and
the snowy range was seen from afar. The view of
“the snows” at Mussoorie is not so commanding as
from the regions about Naini Tal, which I had
visited four months before. The “station” itself
is built on a ridge and its spurs for a distance
of six miles or more, and contained at that time
some thirty thousand inhabitants. The European
residents were made up of retired pensioners of
the Indian Government, a large garrison of English
troops, and others connected with the several
schools for Europeans, and some who engaged in
trade. But here, as elsewhere, the great population
was made up of the natives. The conditions
were as favorable as could be found for rest and
recuperation. There was enough sociability to
keep off loneliness, and plenty of good reading
matter in libraries, and opportunity to roam about
the mountains. I lived much in the open air when
it did not take me into the direct rays of the sun.
Though the atmosphere is almost always cool at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
this altitude, the sunlight searches one through in
the rare atmosphere. It paints the cheeks of every
one like a peach, even the dusky faces of the natives
are given a flush of red. It is doubtful if even
America has much better climatic conditions for
regaining health than many of the Indian hills.
Could we put the American style of living, and the
homelike atmosphere around the sick missionaries
in these hills, it is certain that there would be need
of less home-going. If missionaries could always
retreat to these hills when in a decline before they
are too much reduced, they would gain the necessary
strength to resume their duties.</p>

<p>I spent the time from March until the middle
of June in this station, directing the work off in
Burma as best I could by letter. This was difficult
from the distance of two thousand miles. During
these months I thought of the anomaly of being
presiding elder of a district so far away, being also
a sick man, and yet so hard pressed were we all,
that no other missionary could be spared from any
field to take up the work that I would have so
gladly laid down. It became apparent that I was
not to meet with greatly improved health, even
here. Bishop Thoburn was away in America, and
while he is one of the most hopeful of men, he gave
up all expectations that I would be able to go on
in mission work in India. He had actually selected
my successor in America. But when the time came
to leave home, the brother failed him. As the time
wore away, and there was no material improvement
in my condition, I only hoped to put the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
mission interests in Burma in as good order as I
might be able, and then to return to America.
This was the situation on the 14th day of June.
Just then the heat on the plains of India is most
terrific, and even the hot air and the dust storms
reach such altitudes as Mussoorie. At this time
man and beast pant for “rain.” The barren and
parched earth seems to cry, “rain!” My letters
from Rangoon indicated serious complications in
a business way, and there seemed to be a great
call to come down and put them to rights. The
monsoon had been promised to us; but it had not
come, while from the plains the heat rose as from
a furnace. Thinking I could only do a little more
service for Burma anyway, just to put things to
rights for my successor, I concluded to make the
plunge into that heat, and to go at once, and return
as soon as I could adjust business complications.
Here the physician who had my case said:
“You dare not go into the plains. In your condition
the heat will kill you. You will leave a widowed
wife and two orphaned children, and you
have no right to commit suicide.” But I still
thought it best to risk it for the work’s sake.</p>

<p>I can not forget the awful heat that greeted me
all the way to lower Bengal; it was the worst
where I first entered the plain. Had I died from
the heat at any stage of that journey, I should not
have been surprised. But I lived. I crossed the
bay again, and did three weeks of the hardest work
of my life up to that time in Rangoon. Weary
to exhaustion, I hastened to Calcutta on my return<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
to the mountains. As I lay on the hatch on
that rough passage, I felt that my days as a missionary
were over, and that I had, without a formal
good-bye, left Burma forever.</p>

<p>On landing in Calcutta and getting my “land
legs” again, I met one of the surprises of my life.
I made the glad discovery that I was greatly improved
in health! So certain of this did I become,
that I told the Calcutta missionaries freely that
my days as a missionary were not over. They
would gladly have believed me, but were skeptical,
and warned me that when I should get back to the
hills I would wilt again. They said my apparent
improvement was only due to the excitement of
the journey, and would soon wear away. But I
went further in my conviction, and sent a letter
from Calcutta to Bishop Thoburn in America that
I was better, and expected to return to Burma,
and that the bishop was to strike my name off the
invalid list. The improvement continued after my
return to the hills, and while I expected a long
time to elapse before I would be entirely myself,
I never doubted after that thrill of hope in Calcutta
that I would become a well man again, and
continue my missionary career. It is exceedingly
rare that such a radical improvement in health
occurs under such an extraordinary, if not indeed
perilous, strain as I was under on that trip to
Rangoon. My experience in all this has been given
in some detail, because it shows how a really desperate
case may sometimes turn toward recovery
at the unexpected time. Had I returned to America,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
broken as I was, it would have ended my
missionary career. The Church, and ourselves,
would have been painfully disappointed, for I had
not done what the Church or myself expected, and
it would have been taken for granted that I could
not possibly stand the tropical climate. As it
turned out, I had the honor to continue on the
field, bearing heavy burdens for a rather longer
period than is usual in the first term of missionary
service, and to be permitted to write these records
of nearly ten consecutive years in mission work.
This breakdown taught us a permanent lesson.
No missionary henceforth of our mission should
be required to live in the noise, dirt, and heat of the
town of Rangoon, as we had to live the first year.
We determined to get to the suburbs for quieter
and healthier surroundings. At Rangoon this can
be easily accomplished. Just out of the town
proper, and yet not far distant from our town work,
there is a great cantonment, or military quarter,
reaching for a mile or more. The location is higher
than that of the town. The grounds around residences
are usually extensive; but it was difficult
to rent a house of any value with the mission
money at our command. We secured a tottering
old house belonging to a miserly old man, who
would not keep it in any sort of repair. It leaned
well over to one side, had uneven floors, rickety
stairs, and a roof so full of holes that ventilation
was perfect. Yet we got on well here during the
dry season; but a later experience remains to be
given.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span></p>

<p>From my return to Rangoon both myself and
wife plunged into the work of the mission with
redoubled efforts, that we were not to slacken
for years to come. Mr. Robertson was taken sick
with the fever after having stood at his post
through the six months of my absence, and his
recovery was slow. I had the full pastoral duties,
the business of the mission, Government correspondence
concerning the schools, and the chaplaincy
of the Wesleyan troops, as all our Rangoon
pastors have had in their turn. Besides this, I
did a great deal of district work, mostly of a pioneering
kind. When it is understood that this is
the way many of our missionaries are loaded down,
it must surprise others, as well as themselves, that
they hold out so long under these multiplied labors,
not forgetting that it is always under a tropical sun.</p>

<p>Our lives and labors moved on without special
incident for all the dry season from October, 1892,
to the end of April, 1893, when we entered the
monsoon several days earlier than usual. It is
here that the reader may have the closing reference
to the old house that made up the residence of the
official head of the Burma District at this period.
As I have already stated, the house did very well
as a camping place for the dry season, during which
we seldom have any rain at all. But as the time
for the annual rains approached, I began to press
our miserly landlord to put the roof in order.
This he agreed to do, but the agreement he did
not keep, and the rains came and caught us unprepared.
Bishop Thoburn had just arrived from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
Singapore on his biennial visit. He had reached
our house on the afternoon of the 24th of April.
As the afternoon wore away, there began to be
signs of rain. The monsoon was not supposed to
be due for a week to three weeks yet. However,
showers often come lightly before this date. The
difference between the light showers and the
“bursting of a monsoon” usually is, that the former
are light and merely premonitory of the coming
rains, while they will be followed by much burning
sunshine and increasing heat. The “bursting of
the monsoon” usually lasts for days, and has often
much of storm with it, which also cools the temperature.
Sometimes there is a fall of twenty-five
degrees, but not often, and this is not long maintained.
But on the evening named rain began to
fall very gently, and for an hour or two we were
under the impression that it was only a shower;
but the rain continued through the night. There
was no wind at all, and this led to a most remarkable
circumstance, which I do not know of having
paralleled, or that it has ever been made a matter
of record, though it made a deep impression at the
time. All about Rangoon there is a beautiful shade
tree called the “padauk.” It has a short, thick
trunk and very long, spreading branches. The
most remarkable feature of the tree is that it
blooms three times within six weeks, a heavy
bloom each time, and the third time the bloom
bursts simultaneously with the monsoons.
Strangely enough, at the end of April, at the time
of which I write, there was every indication that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
the <em>third bloom</em> was about to break forth, though
the rains, as stated, were not expected for some
time. So accurately does this tree mark the beginning
of the actual rains, that a common saying
is, “The rains are at hand, the padauk is ready to
bloom the third time.” This was the situation as
we went to sleep that night, thankful for the refreshing
rain, coming so gently also that we did
not see the stir of a leaf. After a very refreshing
sleep, we were wakened just at daybreak by a
great crash, followed almost immediately by another.
I hastened to the veranda only to see the
great padauk trees in front of the house dripping
with water, and at the side of two of them, almost
a quarter of each tree, broken and prostrate on
the earth, while the sounds of breaking trees came
from various directions on other streets. As the
light increased, we looked for a reason for the
breaking of these great branches. We saw the
trees one mass of yellow bloom, and the ground
covered with the fallen flowers. The gentle rain
was still falling through the motionless air. For
a space of three hours after day came the trees
continued to break. When the breeze began to
blow the breaking ceased. Then we were able
to find a cause why these strong trees gave way.
During the night the millions of little flowers on
the ends of those long branches opened with the
rain, and as their cups filled with water, there being
no wind to shake the water down, the weight of
the water held in these flowers acted on the
branches as a great lever and broke them down.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
A really wonderful natural phenomenon! It has
had no repetition since, probably due to the fact
that the rain and the blooming have not been
absolutely simultaneous, with an absence of wind.
As in this case when the breeze started up, the
water was shaken down and the breaking ceased.
When the flowers had fallen from the trees there
could be no more danger; but he who will look
for it, can find the scars on the trees still where
their great branches were broken by the weight
of their own water-laden flowers.</p>

<p>The rain had done havoc in the house also. It
had searched out every hole in that perforated
roof, and the water was dripping from the ceiling
into the middle of the room, and streaming down
from the walls. The rain continued for a term of
eight days, almost uninterruptedly. Housekeeping
was out of the question. We tried to eat at
our table, but were driven away by the water and
dust swept down from the roof onto the food.
There was no help for it. Mrs. Smith’s simple wall
decorations of bric-a-brac were all destroyed. We
had to live about the other mission premises as
best we could during the days that followed. There
was a dry spot in the middle of one room where
the bishop’s bed stood, and he returned to sleep
there each night to keep out of the noise of the
town. So it continued for eight days, to the end of
the bishop’s visit. I suppose that a bishop of Methodism
does not meet with this kind of entertainment
often, even in India, much less in America.
It takes a good man to endure this sort of experience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
and keep sweet, especially as he knows the
home Church has abundant means to house its
missionaries, if it will. And be it remembered that
the Church had never given us a dollar for property
in Burma at that time in the whole history of
the little mission; nor has it yet, except through
the Woman’s Foreign Missionary Society, which
has now begun to help with a really strong hand.
But the good bishop and I determined to buy residence
property, and that on credit, as we had no
money. Any conditions of purchase were less risky
and less expensive than being so poorly housed,
though this plan could not at once be carried out.</p>

<p>Here another painful circumstance occurred.
My family had to live in that house for the six
months of the rains. Just as they were all suffering
with fever, owing to the dampness continually
in the house, a missionary paper from home came,
in which there was a letter by the same Missionary
Secretary who had greeted us with the cry of “the
luxury of Indian missionaries” the first week of our
life in Rangoon, again declaring that “India was
the most sumptuously provided mission-field on
earth!” This letter was intended to take the life
out of a plea for money to buy residences for our
missionaries in India and Burma that Bishop Thoburn
had written. I recall this circumstance here,
solely to show how little the real conditions under
which we have worked in Burma are understood
at home, even by those who at times have had the
charge of mission interests.</p>

<span class="subhead">The Physical Features of Burma</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">It</span> is common to tell of the physical aspects of
a country in one of the first chapters of any
book that may be written giving the characteristics
of any land; but the object of this book is to
present, first, a picture of life in Burma, as the
writer and his associates experienced it. There
is a logical order in taking up the study of the
topography, climate, and products of Burma, as
they were observed from time to time in residence
and travel through that country. That is the way
the observations herein recorded came to the
writer after he had begun the work and care of a
mission in Rangoon and the adjoining regions.</p>

<p>A missionary soon learns to take an interest
in all that affects the life of the people among
whom he labors. He finds that climate determines
the products of a land to a great extent,
and these in turn determine the occupations of
the people. He must adjust himself to these conditions.
He also finds that his plans for a people
must take in their present state and their future
prospects. These conditions are largely material.
The wealth or poverty of a people determines
their spirit and possibilities to a great extent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span></p>

<p>Americans especially, very few of whom have
ever traveled or lived in a tropical country, and
who have not studied conditions in the Eastern
hemisphere, except in the best-known portion of
the Oriental world, have great need of enlargement
of their views on Asiatic questions. In nothing
is this more evident than on the geography
of Southern Asia. While speaking on missions
and Asiatic themes at home recently, I have often
tried to gauge the ideas of my audience by asking
them to guess the length of the Red Sea. I selected
this body of water because it is most familiar
to all Bible-students. I take the Red Sea
because all have heard of it and all have seen it
mapped from childhood, instead of the Gulf of
Martaban, for instance, which lies off the coast
of Burma; for most of my American readers have
scarcely heard of the latter body of water. The
answers to this question from an audience, especially
if it is secured, as it usually has been, on
the moment, have been at once amusing and instructive.
The guesses as to the length of the
Red Sea generally vary from “sixty” to “three
hundred” miles, while a few have gone somewhat
higher. But only one answer secured in months,
and that from a schoolteacher after reflection and
mental calculation, has been <em>half</em> the length of
that historic body of water. Usually an audience
has taken a laugh at the guesser and their own
mental estimate when they have been informed
that the Red Sea is about fifteen hundred miles
long. I have sometimes told the man who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
guessed “one hundred miles” to multiply all his
ideas of the Eastern world by fifteen, and he
would come nearer to the reality than he had been
hitherto.</p>

<p>It is common to hear at home all the land
commonly spoken of as “India” as a land of a
sameness of character, in climate, people, language,
and products. One province of it, like
Burma, is a small section of the country, just like
the rest of the land, and chiefly differing from the
other portions of “India” in geographical lines.
But establish something of the largeness of these
complex countries in the mind, and also their diversity
of people and physical conditions, and the
man so informed is prepared to understand that
Burma may be reckoned as a land of considerable
importance in itself and worthy of special study.</p>

<p>Burma is a land with an area of seventy thousand
square miles. It lies between the Bay of
Bengal and Assam on the west, China on the
north, and French Indo-China and Siam on the
east. It also extends through eighteen degrees
of latitude, from ten to twenty-eight north. In
shape it is a little like the folded right hand, with
index finger only extended southward. Its greatest
width is about four hundred miles, while the
Tennasserim Coast far to the south is but a narrow
strip of land.</p>

<p>The topography of the country is interesting.
There are three principal rivers, the Irrawaddy
(the greatest), the Salween, and the Sitiang. All
these rise in the north, near or beyond the Burmese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
border, and flow southward. Between these
river basins and to the westward of the Irrawaddy
there run ranges of hills rising to mountains.
They range from small, picturesque hillocks that
only serve to divide water-basins to mountains
above ten thousand feet in height. The valleys
are comparatively narrow, but very fertile. The
hills are not simply single crests running parallel
with the rivers, but are extensive successions of
ranges quite regular, with indications here and
there of volcanic action. The strata are very much
broken. For this reason the coal-fields of Burma
are not of much value, owing to the broken condition
of the strata. When one little portion is
worked for a distance, the vein is lost, being removed
or buried too deep for work.</p>

<p>The Irrawaddy River deserves special mention.
It rises somewhere in the heights of Thibet near
the headwaters of the Indus and the Ramaputra.
It is noteworthy that the three great rivers of
Southern Asia rise very near each other and flow
to the ocean so far apart. The Irrawaddy breaks
through the hills of northern Burma, and descends
into the plains, widening and gathering
volume till it reaches the sea. It has several navigable
river tributaries, of which the Chindwin is
chief. Toward the lower end of its course it
connects with a network of tidal creeks that unite
with its several mouths, one of which is the Rangoon
River. This system of internal water-ways
makes it possible to traverse all portions of Lower
Burma with river steamers of various sizes, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
a steam launch to river boats as large and well
equipped as those of the Mississippi. The enterprising
and prosperous Flotilla Company of Burma
has a great fleet of these vessels running on the
Irrawaddy and its tributaries, while the many
steamers and launches utilize the tidal creeks.
This great enterprise has no rival for this river-borne
traffic. The amount of business done on the
Irrawaddy is enormous. The Salween is navigable
for only thirty miles by ocean steamers, and the
Sitiang not at all at present, though formerly sailing
vessels made ports about its mouth. Steam
launches still ply on both these streams and their
tributaries. On all these inland waters there are
multitudes of native boats, of curious but most
serviceable pattern. They never modify these
Eastern crafts after any Western design. It is
doubtful if modern ships have made much improvement
in their water-lines over many Eastern
boats, which can be seen in different styles everywhere,
from the Red Sea all around the coasts
of Southern Asia. They vary greatly in different
countries, and have become fixed along certain
accepted lines from which they do not depart, but
they all seem to be good. Of all Oriental crafts
I have seen, none are more picturesque than the
Burma river boats.</p>

<p>The mountain areas of Burma affect the country
in many ways. They greatly affect the rainfall.
Lower Burma receives the full force of the
monsoon current as it comes in off the Indian
Ocean. The consequence is a heavy rainfall each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
year, and a regular and bountiful harvest. Lower
Burma has never had a famine. The amount of
rainfall varies from one hundred to three hundred
inches during the rainy season of six months. The
western side of the outer range of the hills, exposed
to the same current, has even a heavier fall
of rain than the low lands bordering on the sea.
The coast range of hills rises to a considerable altitude,
and as they extend north and south, the
southwest rain currents pour out their water in
crossing this range, and so have little moisture left
to furnish rain in the upper valleys of Burma.
While the sea coast round about Rangoon, and
the Sitiang and Irrawaddy Valleys, have abundant
rains in the lower portions, as you go northward in
each valley the rainfall steadily decreases until in
portions of Upper Burma there are great areas
of land that will seldom give a crop for lack of
moisture. The soil in this arid region is as fertile
as anywhere, and where the great and enlarging
canal system of the Government is effective, they
can produce enormous harvests. But left to the
uncertain rainfall, there would be only failure of
crops and famine. Happily this condition does not
extend over the most thickly-populated portion
of Burma.</p>

<p>In another respect the hill portion of Burma is
important. Compared with the plains or plateaus
of the country, there is a relatively smaller portion
of the province of low elevations than that of India
proper. The greatest level area is bordering on
the sea, and is in consequence much modified by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
the sea breezes, and the heat is never very intense
for a tropical country. But a large portion of the
province, which is not cooled by the breeze from
the sea, has also a moderate heat for the tropics.
I attribute this condition of modified temperature
to the fact that we have no <em>large plains</em> or plateaus.
Unlike India, where the area that becomes superheated
is immense, in Burma the area of low
land is small, and therefore is continually modified
by the cooler air from the large adjacent mountain
tracts. This, it seems to me, accounts for the fact
that all the seacoast of Burma is so much cooler
than the same kind of elevation of Bengal. They
both alike share the sea breeze for a certain distance;
but Bengal has hundreds of miles of low
plain unbroken by high hills, while Burma’s hills
approach near the sea. This gives Burma a relatively
moderate temperature, though so far down
in the tropics. All the valleys of the tropical world
are fertile. But a word should be said about the
fertility of the mountain tracts of Burma. Nearly
all of these hills and mountains that I have seen are
covered with a dense growth of forest. The Indian
hills are not so. Many of the latter are entirely
barren of trees, and where there is any chance at
all they are cultivated in terraces. But the virgin
forests of Burma stretch hundreds of miles over
hills and mountains. Here and there are villagers,
it is true, mostly Karens, in Lower Burma, who
cultivate only small areas; but only one year in a
place, making a new clearing each year to avoid
the work of digging or plowing, and then they let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
the last year’s clearing grow up to forest again,
which it quickly does.</p>

<p>There is room for a vast population to make an
easy living in the hills of Burma alone. If those
fertile hills were in America, they would be all
occupied as cattle and horse ranches, if not cultivated.
Wherever the forest is thinned or cut
away, a great luxuriant growth of grass and bamboos
springs up, on which cattle feed and flourish.
They can get plenty of grazing the year round in
these hills, and there would always be a ready
market for beef and for bullocks for plowing.</p>

<p>Among the many natural resources of Burma,
there are two that require careful attention. Here
we find one of the greatest rice-growing countries
of the world. Here also are vast forests of the
famous teak wood, that is used so extensively for
ship-building and other structures.</p>

<p>Rice-growing is the <em>one</em> line of cultivation that
characterizes the land of Burma. In India there
are greater rice fields, because the rice lands are
more extensive. But in India they cultivate other
crops, and this even on the rice land. In India
they frequently, if not generally, grow two or more
crops on the same land in one year, or different
crops on adjacent land at the same season. But
the Burman grows one crop only, and that is uniformly
rice. He is a rice-grower and a rice-eater.
In the plains there is no other grain grown that is
generally used for human food. There is a little
Indian corn cultivated, but not in sufficient amount
to break the force of this general statement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span></p>

<p>The rice fields of Burma amount to over six
million acres. There are often as many as one
hundred bushels of unhusked rice grown on an
acre. Of course, the average yield is far below this
amount. Yet the aggregate rice crop is enormous.
It feeds all Burma, and there are vast quantities
shipped to India, China, Europe, and South America.
No year since I have been in Burma has there
been insufficient rice for her people. If rice of
a different variety comes to Burma for the immigrants
that are used to the Indian article, there is
also much Burma rice shipped annually to various
ports in India.</p>

<p>A word should be added as to rice cultivation.
Perhaps all readers are aware that rice is grown
usually in water, though there is some dry cultivation.
The land is inclosed in very small fields,
averaging less than one acre, but often not more
than one-tenth of that area. There are embankments
round all these fields, and several inches of
water are kept always on the ground. Sometimes
the water is a foot deep. So long as the rice
can have a very little of the upper blade out of
the water it will flourish. The ground is stirred
with a wooden rake like a plow when it is covered
with water. The mud is made very fine, and as
deep as this mode of cultivation, will stir it. The
rice has been sown in nurseries, and when from a
foot to fifteen inches high it is pulled up, bound
into bundles of approximately one hundred plants
each, and taken, usually in boats, to the prepared
field, where it is all transplanted by hand. Often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
the root is divided, so that from one grain there
come to be grown several bunches of rice. In
appearance a rice field looks very much like a field
of oats. The reader will hardly be prepared to
believe that it takes nearly twice as long to mature
a rice crop under a tropical sun, as it does to grow
a field of oats in the northern latitudes, especially
in America. The rice is sown in the nursery in
May or June, and the ripened grain is not harvested
before the last of December or in January. It is
all cut with a sickle. I have never seen any one
harvesting with any other instrument in Southern
Asia. The grain is always threshed under the feet
of cattle, and winnowed by hand. An American
sees hundreds of ways wherein this crop could be
grown more economically, and some missionary
will yet introduce modern methods successfully.
The missionary is the only man likely to succeed
in such a task.</p>

<p>When speaking of the great food-producing industries
of Burma, that of fishing should have special
prominence. Burma has a vast area of swamps
submerged every rainy season, and these are
classed as “fisheries,” and a very large revenue
is secured from the sale of the fish. The fisherman
makes an excellent living, and the people almost
universally are able to eat fish with their rice. So
long has this been the case that no Burman considers
that he has been well fed unless he has fish
of some sort with rice every day. Then he shares
the characteristic of all Asiatics in desiring much
condiment with his rice. He therefore takes the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
fish, which is of fine flavor and excellent quality
when fresh, and rots it, and mixes with it peppers
and other spices until it suits his taste and smell,
and then feasts! Other less Burmanized people
declare that his “gnape,” as he calls this preparation,
is simply very rotten fish.</p>

<p>The teak-wood forests, before mentioned, are
among the most valuable in the world. This famous
wood will not shrink under the most intense
sun’s rays, nor will it expand when wet with the
rain. It does not warp, and has a smooth grain
and works easily. In the tropics, when used for
building purposes, it is not eaten by white ants,
which destroy almost all other building material in
hot countries. The Government has taken hold
of this industry, and protects the trees from fires,
regulates the cutting, and does all it can to maintain
and extend these exceedingly valuable forests.
The cutting of the trees, their transport to
the sea, and conversion into lumber is one of the
greatest organized industries in the country. The
amount of money required to carry on this business
in the process of cutting the timber from the
stump, hundreds of miles inland, gathering it out
of the forests, carrying it in rafts to the seaports,
and putting it through the great sawmills, to the
final disposal to the European and other purchasers,
is enormous. The time element is a large
one. It takes years to get these logs through the
process. I have often desired to know just how
long this timber has been waiting or is in transit
from the time it was felled. This at least must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
several years, for the logs often show signs of
hard usage through a long period. They are sometimes
cracked and worn as if decades old.</p>

<figure id="i_83" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img src="images/i_083.jpg" width="2112" height="1191" alt=" ">
    <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Elephant at Work</span>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It is in this timber industry that the elephants
of Burma are very useful. All travelers visiting
Burma have at least seen the elephant at work in
the mills of Rangoon. They drag the great logs
from the river, place them in position to be guided
to the saws, drag away the slabs and squared lumber,
pile all these in orderly heaps ready for further
handling, and manipulate the logs and ropes
and their own chains in a marvelous way. They
go in and out of the mills with every part of the
great machinery running, and never make a false
motion to tramp on a carriage, become entangled
in the belting, or allow a whirling saw to touch
their precious skins. Why a great beast with such
strength, joined to such intelligence and self-possession,
will submit to the feeble and often stupid
man who sits on his neck, and work for man at all,
is a marvel. But the transient visitor only sees the
elephant working in the mills. This is only a
small part of his task. He does all the heavy dragging
of the logs to get them to the river from the
forest where they are grown. This is often over
the most difficult ground. He will go into a thicket
where no other beast can go, where a horse or an
ox could not climb at all, or if he did, would be perfectly
useless for work. But the elephant goes
into these worst places and drags the logs over
fallen trees, bowlders, and through mud, not being
dismayed by muddy ditches or rocky steeps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span></p>

<p>It is no wonder that the Government protects
the herds of wild elephants. But sometimes they
invade the rice fields in great numbers. When they
do, the destruction is so great that the officials give
license to go and shoot them. Sometimes the hunters
succeed in killing a few. If they are males,
the tusks are very valuable. The feet are also
skinned, including the leg, sole of the feet, and the
nails, and when so prepared are often used as
waste-paper baskets, and are regarded as great
curiosities.</p>

<p>Burma has great ruby mines; but as these
stones are not of so much value as formerly, the
mining is not to be considered as constituting a
great industry. But the oil fields of Burma are
very valuable, and it is supposed that the industry
is as yet only in its early beginning. It is said that
the company that owns the chief refinery, and
many of the oil fields, will not sell any part of
the stock they hold, and that they are getting rich
rapidly.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the foregoing facts that
Burma is a great land in itself. It belongs to the
Indian Empire, and it is the richest province in the
whole country. It pays all its own expenses, which
are heavy, and gives largely to the deficit of other
provinces. As a field for mission work, there is
none more promising so far as natural conditions
are concerned.</p>

<span class="subhead">The City of Rangoon</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Rangoon</span> may not perhaps be rated as a
great, but it is an important, city. The
population of Rangoon numbers above two hundred
thousand, without the usual thickly-inhabited
suburbs. It is a seaport third in importance in
Southern Asia. Calcutta and Bombay are the only
cities that surpass it. The capital of the province
of Burma, it is the center of official life. Being
situated so near the sea, only twenty miles inland,
and having the best of harbors and every connection
with the interior, both by rail and river, its
importance as a trading center is very great. Compared
to other Indian cities, it is more important
than many with a greater population, while it is
doubtful if any city in all the seacoasts of Southern
Asia is of equal importance in proportion to its
population. Then, it has the advantage of being a
newly-planned city. As such it has straight streets,
crossing at right angles for the most part, like
Western cities of the modern plan. However, this
admirable arrangement has been of far less advantage
than it would have been, because the blocks
are too narrow to be utilized to the best advantage.
This blunder has, unhappily, been perpetuated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
in the great new addition that has been made
on the eastward of the city. It would seem that
experience in this matter would have taught the
municipality better things; but like other things
Oriental, I suppose, they found it very difficult
to get adapted to anything new. As the beginning
was made that way, the end must be the same.
But in the one fact that the streets are straight
and at right angles, there is an advantage that is
not found in any other Oriental city. The streets
are kept well paved, and the general improvements
are progressive, except in two very important particulars.
They still use poor kerosene in inferior
lamps for street lighting. Ten years ago I went to
the municipal engineer, and asked him if it was not
feasible to light the city with electricity, instead of
the obsolete methods then, as now, in vogue. He
said: “Yes, it might be; but we are not so enterprising
as you in America. We will wait ten years,
and see if a new thing works well before we adopt
it.” The ten years are passed, and still the smoky
old lamps send out their indifferent light and obnoxious
odors—too many of which befoul any
Oriental city—because the municipal authorities
have not yet found out that electric lighting is
a success. This is being written in America,
where most little towns of one or two thousand
population are being well lighted with electricity,
while over the sea the great city of Rangoon, with
two hundred thousand inhabitants and large revenues,
can not yet venture on this modern system
of lighting its streets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span></p>

<p>There is, also, a lamentable backwardness in
the matter of street railways. There is a poorly-built
and poorly-kept street railway run by steam.
But there is little comfort in the car service, and
the motive power is antiquated steam engines.
The street railway, such as it is, is not extended to
such limits as it should be. Were the streets
lighted with electric-lights and a system of electric
cars adequate to the city and suburbs running,
these public improvements would be in keeping
with what Rangoon is in the matter of trade.</p>

<p>There is only one other city in Burma of nearly
the same number of inhabitants as Rangoon, and
that is Mandalay, the capital of Upper Burma.
This city was the capital of independent Burma in
modern times. When the British annexed Upper
Burma in 1886, they projected the railway to the
city of Mandalay, and as it already had steamer
connection with Lower Burma, its many advantages
as a distributing center maintained its continued
growth. While it has a population nearly
equal to Rangoon, it has nothing else to be compared
with the latter city.</p>

<p>There is a very great contrast between the two
cities in the matter of racial population. While
Mandalay has some immigrants from other lands,
like other cities and towns of Burma, the city as a
whole is distinctly Burman. Rangoon, on the
other hand, is so foreign in its makeup that it can
not be called a Burmese city. Relatively, very few
Burmans live in the main part of the city. Here
you find many peoples of India. There are wide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
areas of the city given over to the Tamils, Telegus,
Bengalis, Gujaratties, and Chinese; while yet other
Indian people are found in this Indian community
to the exclusion of the Burmese. The Burmese
live chiefly at both ends of the city of Rangoon,
where there is much trading in rice and other dealings
of a Burmese character. The Burmese have
given way before the immigrants of India, largely
because they are an independent and proud race,
and will not do the work commonly done by the
coolies and servants about the city. They look
upon the immigrant from India as an inferior, and
they will not allow themselves to be his competitor
for the more menial services and work of the city.
The Burmese, therefore, collect chiefly where they
have occupation congenial to their tastes. It is
significant that the Burman will work at almost
anything, where the Madrassis and other Indian
people are not working alongside of him. But
where there may be constant contrasts or comparisons
in inferior positions, he will not condescend
to go. So he gives way to the native as indicated,
not from necessity, but from choice.</p>

<p>Rangoon is a great trade center. The two
greatest industries are that of the lumber trade and
the traffic in rice. The lumber manufacture and
sale has had previous mention. I will only add
that immense sawmills line the river front at frequent
intervals, and the logs lie in the river in
great rafts, or in heaps on land. There are perhaps
scores of elephants at work in connection
with these mills.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span></p>

<p>The rice mills are conducted on a very large
scale. The plan is common to make advances to
brokers, who go out and loan money on the growing
crop and agree to take the rice, which in the
husk is called “paddy,” at harvest time, at a given
rate per hundred baskets. The basket holds about
a bushel. Usually the price ranges about one hundred
rupees for a hundred baskets, though often
the rice is a fourth above or a fourth below this
amount. The rupee is equal to thirty cents. As
the price of rice is impossible of calculation so
many months in advance of harvest, the millers
who advance the money to the brokers, who are
usually Burmans, and the brokers who advance
the money to the cultivators agreeing to take
“paddy” at a given rate at harvest, and the cultivators,
all base their calculations upon guesses
usually wrong, the whole system has much of the
elements of gambling, like the dealing in futures on
an American Board of Trade. The rice is husked
and cleaned in these great mills, and sold to buyers
from abroad, or in the local markets for food.
Often the cleaned rice is sent to Europe, and converted
into some kind of intoxicants, and comes
back to curse the land out of which it grew. It
is noteworthy that most of these greater business
enterprises that call for great organization are
managed by Europeans. But there are many merchants
in wholesale or retail business that are of
all races. The Chinamen are busy traders, and
will doubtless have a more controlling voice in the
affairs of business as time goes forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span></p>

<p>Of all the trade in the country, there are two
features that are a source of unmixed evil—the
trade in opium, and the trade in liquor. It is true
that the Government tries to keep the opium trade
under very severe regulations; but it is always a
failure to try to regulate that which itself feeds
upon vice. The amount of liquor brought into
Burma is something enormous. It is true that
there are more people that do not drink than formerly,
and those that still drink are less given to
excessive drunkenness than in earlier years; yet
there are more people in the land, and there are
more of the natives, particularly Burmese, that
are using intoxicants, in imitation of Europeans,
and therefore the quantity of liquor brought to the
country to supply this demand is greater than ever
before. The ship that our party went on to Rangoon
carried three missionaries and three hundred
tons of liquor. I have no doubt this would not
be above the average cargo for steamers plying
between European ports and Burma. It is astonishing
how this liquor has entered into ordinary
trade. Most of the great importing houses deal
in liquors. Most of the retail houses likewise. So
it becomes difficult for a young man who is hostile
to the whole liquor business to get work in any of
the retail “shops,” as they are called, without
staining his hands in this unholy traffic. One of
the great reforms on the temperance questions
in the East will be to develop a sentiment antagonistic
to the traffic, until liquor-selling can not be
countenanced as a respectable business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span></p>

<p>Rangoon has several good public buildings,
the greatest of these being the Government House,
the residence of his honor the lieutenant-governor,
and the great secretariat building, which is situated
on grounds reserved for its use, in the center
of the city. The latter building has been completed
only about five years, and when newly occupied
was considerably shaken by the heavy earthquake,
which shook Rangoon and vicinity. But
the damage done has been repaired, and the great
building adorns the city and serves the purpose
for which it was erected. There is also the elegant
Jubilee Hall erected in honor of Queen Victoria’s
illustrious reign.</p>

<p>Rangoon is divided into two distinct parts. The
one is on the flat land adjoining the river, and extending
a third of a mile back, and some four miles
in length. This includes most of the business portion
and all the crowded districts of the city. Here
many thousands of people literally swarm by day,
and sleep twenty in a single room at night. This
portion of the city is called “The Town.” It is
almost always very dirty, except when washed by
heavy rains. Here are still seen old buildings of
every sort. However, these are disappearing more
rapidly than one would anticipate, from the fact
that they were originally all constructed of wood,
and during the dry weather there have been frequent
friendly fires of late years, and the town is
by this means relieved of a good many unsightly
structures. Henceforth there are to be no wooden
buildings erected in the center of the city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span></p>

<p>During the rains we are treated to a curious
effect of the excessive moisture of the climate.
Many of the old houses have been roofed by clay
tiling. When this tiling is not frequently turned,
the spores of certain weeds, which have gathered
on the tiles as the rains increase and the clouds
settle down in unbroken shadows over the land,
spring up and grow to the height of two feet or
more, growing as thick as grass in a meadow. This
makes a house a very curious-looking object. A
human habitation or church grown all over with
weeds! When the clouds break away and the sun
comes out, these weeds dry to a crisp.</p>

<p>Any student of a people, and most of all a missionary,
is early attracted by the religious life of
men. Of the many races that mix, but do not
blend, in the population of Rangoon, each brings
his own religion from the land of his birth. Each
holds to his own faith with the greatest persistency,
as a rule. Men will have dealings together on all
subjects, except in religion. Here they differ
widely, and they generally do not compromise their
religious convictions or observance. Sometimes
their dispositions to each other are that of covert
hostility. But generally they get on in outward
peace, but do not think of becoming proselytes to
any other religion. The religious rites at the
shrines are kept up faithfully. The great religious
feasts are observed with much pomp. The social
customs that are connected with each religion are
seldom broken. So living side by side are adherents
of every religion under the sun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span></p>

<p>In the center of Dalhousie Street in Rangoon
is a large pagoda, a shrine of the Buddhists, with
its gilded conical shape rising far above all other
buildings in the vicinity, while from its umbrella-like
top there goes out on the tropical air the
sweet sound of bells that hang on the rim of the
umbrella. Just across the street from this pagoda
is a mosque where the Mohammedan business men
and passers-by go five times a day to pray. Two
blocks east from these is a Hindu temple, and three
or four blocks west is a Chinese temple, where their
religious rites are observed, consisting mostly of
offerings to devils. These temples are only samples.
I understand there are a score of mosques
in Rangoon. The number of Hindu temples I do
not know, while there are pagodas in every quarter.
There are various Chinese temples also.
Throughout the city are now found several Christian
Churches. Here the gospel light is held up
to dispel the soul-darkening counsels of the Christless
faiths. At a glance at these sacred places
and religious rites it will be seen that the conflict
between religious ideas and practices is general,
and probably will become world-wide. The Europeans
that go to that country must represent the
Christian religion, or deteriorate religiously. The
non-Christians must stand by their own, or in time
they too will become modified. This is wholly independent
of the aggressive battle that the missionary
would wage against all these non-Christian
religious systems. It is a significant fact that the
missionaries who are in the midst of the religious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
life, so opposed to all they hold dear in faith and
practice, have unbounded confidence in the final
triumph of the gospel in leavening the present-day
pagan faiths, as it did those of the New Testament
times. I have yet to meet a hopeless missionary.
This note of the hopeful conquering missionary
force is an inbreathing of the Spirit of our Lord,
who from his throne sends forth his heralds.</p>

<p>One fact will show how intense is the religious
faith among some of the Asiatics. The Mohammedans
and the Hindus are often very hostile to each
other. If it were not for the hand of the English
Government in India, this hostility would be almost
continually breaking out into open violence in some
parts of the country. As it is, it is not seldom that
religious riots occur. In 1894, during a Mohammedan
feast, in which they are accustomed to sacrifice
a cow, the Mohammedans were determined
to slaughter the animal not far from a business
house of a rich Hindu, on whose premises there
was also a private temple. As the Hindus worship
the cow, and as the killing of such an animal,
especially in religious services, is an abomination
to them, they were naturally much incensed, and
the Mohammedans probably meant that they
should be. In this case the Mohammedans seemed
to be the aggressors throughout. The fanatical
antagonism was growing dangerous. The authorities
were watching the movements of these two
parties, the Mohammedans giving most concern.
Several days went by, and the feeling was at fever
heat. Sunday came, and as I rode to church with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
my family in the early morning, I saw on every
street companies of Mohammedans carrying clubs
faced with irons, hurrying toward the center of the
town where their greatest mosque is, and near
which they meant to sacrifice the cow. Just as I
concluded the morning service, I heard the sound
of distant firing. In a few moments a Mohammedan
ran by the church, with his face partly shot
away. The excitement in the city grew as the facts
became known.</p>

    <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Mosque, Rangoon</span>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The deputy commissioner and other officers
were present at the center of the disturbance with
a small company of Seik soldiers. The mob grew
to many thousands, and the officers commanded
them to disperse. This order they refused in derisive
language. Then blank cartridges were fired
to frighten the multitude, and still they refused to
disperse. As there was nothing left to do, the
troops were ordered to fire into the crowd that
thronged about the mosque. Some thirty or more
were shot, several being killed outright. This dispersed
the crowds, but there was rioting for days
whenever Mohammedans would find a Hindu away
from his associates, or in unfrequented or unprotected
localities. Had it not been for these rigorous
measures of the authorities, the whole community
would have been given over to violence.
As it was, the whole Mohammedan community was
doubly policed for six months, and the extra expense
was put on to the tax of that particular community.
This was effective in keeping order, and
when the time had run its course, the Mohammedans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
petitioned the local Government that if these
extra police were taken away, they would behave
themselves, which they have done ever since.</p>

<p>While “the Town” is such a center of life and
strife, the suburbs are a place of quiet, rest, cleanliness,
and beauty unsurpassed. The military cantonment
is here, with perhaps nearly a mile square,
laid out in large blocks and roomy compounds, or
yards. A rule has long been in force in the cantonment,
that there could only be one house
erected on a lot. Most of these lots contain from
one to four acres. This gives the room necessary
to beautify the grounds, and to secure pure air.
The cantonment is now being curtailed, and doubtless
this admirable regulation may be modified.
But as this land rises a little higher than the town,
and, being a little apart from it, it will continue to
be of great value for homes. The entire suburbs
have a fine growth of trees, many of them natural
forest trees and others ornamental, and planted
for shade.</p>

<figure id="i_103" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 33em;">

    <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Entrance of Sway Dagon Pagoda</span>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The chief object of all the region, the great
Pagoda, is situated about the middle of this cantonment
portion of the suburbs. But the suburbs
run far beyond the cantonment. It reaches on
three sides of this reserve, while the whole region
to the northward is being occupied and built upon.
There is a fine grove of forest and fruit trees extending
most of the way to Insein, nine miles from
Rangoon, and nearly all the intermediate area is
built up with fine residences of Europeans, or rich
natives. The homes out in the groves, and with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
large fruit gardens, furnish the ideal place for rest
and refreshment after the work of the hot day in
“the Town.” It is a fact that Europeans who have
lived for a while in this portion of the city of Rangoon
seem loath to leave it for any place. If they
go back to Europe, they mostly return again to
Rangoon. Government House, a large palatial
building, the residence of the lieutenant-governor,
is the central attraction of all the fine residences of
this region.</p>

<p>There are three areas of great beauty reserved
by the authorities—the Zoological Gardens, the
Cantonment Gardens, and the Royal Lakes. All
these reserves are beautiful with every variety of
tree, bush, and flower that grows in the tropics,
and the grounds are laid out with artistic care, and
lakelets beautify the whole. But the “Royal
Lakes” are a series of natural and artificial water
basins, all connected and adorned with beautiful
little islands and curved shore lines. A portion of
the inclosure is kept as a public park, and a winding
drive is maintained along the water’s edge,
which gives an ever-changing picture of tropical
beauty. The effect of the palms, the mangoes, and
other shade and ornamental trees, toning down the
fierce glare of the sun, and these shades reflected
from the clear water on a tropical evening, is a
blending of color that I have never seen anywhere
equaled. The world has many places of beauty,
but of those views I have seen nothing equals the
“Royal Lakes” of Rangoon for combinations of
charming scenery in a limited area. Evening and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
morning this drive is crowded with vehicles of
every type. Rangoonites of every race are out
taking in the air and scenery. Here in the evening
may be seen hundreds of people dressed in the
coolest apparel, visiting and resting, while two or
three evenings a week the band entertains with
music. It is no wonder that Rangoon makes an
attractive city for business and pleasure for any
whose lot is cast in this tropical land. The heat
is never as intense as in Indian cities, and always
in the hottest weather it is modified with a sea-breeze.
In the long and heavy rains also the people
seem to get no harm from a frequent exposure.</p>

<span class="subhead">Europeans, Anglo-Indians, Eurasians</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">All</span> people of foreign blood from western
lands, and the descendants of these, however
remote or however little the trace of Western
blood they have, are in India technically called
“Europeans.” Before the law they have the rights
of a trial by jury, and in the school laws they are
classed as “Europeans.” But it is far more accurate
to divide this class into three divisions—the
pure “Europeans,” the “Anglo-Indians,” and the
“Eurasians.” By this division the Europeans are
people born and reared in Europe, or America,
who are now found in Southern Asia. The Anglo-Indians
are those people of mixed European blood
who have been born and reared in India. The
Eurasian, as the name implies, is a man who has
both European and Asiatic blood. For the purposes
of comparison these may be named in two
classes, the Western born and bred man, the European,
as distinguished from Eastern born relatives,
Anglo-Indians and Eurasians. I want it
made very clear that in discussing the characteristics
and relations of these several peoples, that
I am not drawing invidious comparisons. I have
no sympathy whatever with asperities heaped upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
men because of their race; neither do I patronize
any man because of his race. I long ago concluded
that character is not a matter of race; that lovable
or royal manhood is not a question of ancestry or
position, but that nearly all essential differences
in men are due to environment and to personal
conduct, for which each man is responsible. But
comparisons not invidious must be made to bring
out the various features of social and business life
that enter into the complex racial intermingling of
Southern Asia. At best this complexity of life can
be but partially understood by readers in America,
who have never seen anything quite like it.</p>

<p>The characteristics of Europeans and Americans
are well known in the Western world. My
subject calls for only those characteristics which
they hold in common, and these features of character
as modified by residence in the tropics and
under the social conditions of Asia. These characteristics
are contrasted in a decided way, as compared
with any and all Asiatic trained men of any
race or racial mixture. These elements of character
are most noticeable in the energy that takes
them to the tropics, their capacity to organize business
or government, and maintain a modern and
systematic organization of the highest efficiency,
and that peculiar capacity for just and progressive
governmental domination. This energy and this
capacity for organization, which of course involves
the power to work out painstaking details, are characteristic
of the Northern civilization, and never
found in the same degree, as far as I know, among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
any peoples that have been bred in the tropics. It
is a matter of great importance in working out the
simplest framework of a theory of racial influence
in the world to recognize the fact that all real
pioneering, all colossal accomplishments in all
lands in modern times, have been made by men
bred in the colder countries of the temperate zone.
These are the men who forge the world forward
in their own native climes, and in the frigid zone,
and also in the scorching tropics. The tropical
world presents no people who hold their own with
these exotics, even under their native skies. It is
this quality of the European that makes him the
dominating man in India. He creates and fosters
government and business enterprises on a large
scale. As a man, the European is a mightier personal
force than Asia can produce.</p>

<p>That this energy is largely a result of climate
and social environment is very plain when we compare
the Western man with the characteristics of
the descendants of Europeans who have had only
an Indian upbringing. And in all comparisons I
will class the Anglo-Indian and the Eurasian together,
for so they belong. They both follow the
same habits of life, so far as style of living is concerned,
similar to that of the European resident in
India. In these respects they have much in common
with all Europeans. They are all classed
together as compared with the native. But here
the similarity between the imported man and his
Indian-bred relative comes to an abrupt end. The
driving and conquering energy of the Western man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
is wanting in his relative of even one generation
of Asiatic breeding. It is clear that this difference,
which all observing men recognize, is purely due
to environment of climate and social customs.
They are as bright in mind as the Western men.
They are excellent students to a certain point.
They are specially facile letter-writers. But the
line of occupations which their Asiatic life and conditions
fit them for, is very limited indeed. The
limitations of their lives are many. The most depressing
of all their conditions grows out of the
fact that they from infancy are dependent for the
greater part of all life’s duties on the native servant.
The baby is nursed by a native <i>ayah</i>; his clothes
are kept in order for him by a servant. He is fed,
clothed, and cared for by half a dozen menials.
His boots are blacked for him; his books carried
to school; his umbrella held over his head; his
pony is groomed, saddled, and led while he rides,
by a servant whom he is accustomed to command
in everything. He is helped and coddled out of all
independence and self-helpfulness. In all this he
is not to be blamed, but pitied. In this he does as
all his relatives and neighbors do. His household
and business methods, all that he sees, is being
done this way. Not one man of European descent
in India lives entirely by his own efforts, as is common
in Western countries. His dependence on
menials is therefore a necessity of respectable life,
as he sees it. He is not to be blamed, for he sees
nothing better around him. But this admission
does not require that we approve the social conditions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
that unman him and rob him of much
energy and resourcefulness in the matter of self-help.
It is a fact that he develops a softness of
character in matters of personal habit, and lacks
in the energy which is required only by long and
sustained self-dependent work. For this reason
all the hardier traits of manhood are feebly developed,
or lacking. You do not find these men entering
callings where hard service is required. They
do not make either soldiers or sailors. Some of
them become engineers, but they are only found in
places where the work is largely done by native
helpers, and even here few of them compete with
the Scotch or German engineer.</p>

<p>But the difference wrought by social conditions
is seen more in matters of disposition than elsewhere.
No race of the human family can boast
of good dispositions. However, we do find that
Indian-born men are unduly sensitive. They are
usually easily “offended,” even to pouting. They are
sensitive of their “status,” whatever their positions
may be. A multiplied illustration of this supersensitiveness
is found in the recklessness with which
men will resign from any and every post when,
for some reason or without reason, their feelings
are hurt. They will often go from comfort to beggary
just because they may be displeased with their
treatment. And that which seems almost a paradox,
compared with the preceding fact, is that they
will stand almost any amount of outright snubbing
from people whom they respect for some pretentious
assumption of superiority. I have been puzzled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
many times to understand how it was when I
went to a disgruntled man with soft speech to
pacify him, if for reason or without it he was disaffected,
to find that he would take my approach
to him as a sign of weakness, and be confirmed in
his unlovely manners. But I have seen the same
man benefited by the sharpest rebuke which gave
him no quarter at all.</p>

<p>But while the Anglo-Indians have all the disposition
in common with the Eurasian, they are
distinguished in common speech in a way that often
causes much pain to high-minded Eurasians. They
are called “Half-castes” and “Niggers.” They are
scorned for being born of questionable parentage.
This is by no means true of the most of these unfortunate
people, as an increasing proportion of
them are born in wedlock, and often are the children
of cultured and orderly homes, the equal of
any on earth. But when true as a fact, it does not
affect their character or real moral worth. But
there is a sting, the more painful for its injustice,
on the innocent child born of mixed parentage,
when born out of wedlock, which in the cruelty of
social speech attaches more shame to the innocent
child than guilt to the heartless father. I have been
led to believe that this injustice accounts for much
of the supersensitiveness in the whole Eurasian
community. Then they labor under the disadvantage
often of having a very dark skin. It is a
curious law of nature that the Eurasian child often
has a darker skin than even his Asiatic parent.
In a country where shades of color, light or dark,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
are measured by a supersensitive scale, and social
recognition is to some extent based upon this absurd
measurement, it will be seen that the Eurasian,
especially if very dark, is overmuch pained that he
has not a white skin, and he feels the fling of the
term “Nigger,” often on the lips of those whose
only whiteness is in their skins.</p>

<p>One more characteristic of the Asiatic-bred
men of European descent may be given. They do
not take kindly to burdensome responsibilities,
even after Indian pattern, especially for their own
kindred and race. In a country where there are
more charitable institutions in proportion to the
population than in any other in the world, and perhaps
greater need of such institutions, yet it remains
a painful fact that, with a few exceptions—so
exceptional as to make the real nobility of the
mind of the few more striking—there is a very
small part of the money necessary for their support
given by the Anglo-Indians, or Eurasians. The
greatest amount of money to keep these institutions
going is given by men foreign to the country.
But another like fact of note is this, that there is
not one such institution, so far as I can learn, the
burdensome responsibility of which is actually carried
by an Indian-bred man, or company of men.
There are many working faithfully in subordinate
capacities. But when it comes to organizing and
maintaining such an institution, and bearing its
burdens through crises, the Indian-bred men have
not been found under the load. The suggestiveness
of these facts is a commentary on either the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
lack of real charity, or lack of energy to bear responsible
burdens. Having been in this sort of
work in various capacities for all the time I have
been in the mission field, I feel it is due to the institutions
of this kind, and the workers who bear the
burdens of the same, to point out this failure of this
branch of the Indian peoples to measure up to a
manifest duty, and to say further, that I believe this
shrinking from personal responsibility to be a direct
result of training from childhood, which
teaches them to avoid unpleasant tasks and drop
them upon others. They would order a servant
to do the work if it could be done that way; but if
not, then the Western man or woman must do it,
or it goes undone.</p>

<p>One more characteristic must be mentioned.
It can not be denied that the lack of manly independence
in a majority of Indian-bred men leads
them to be forever asking somebody to do something
for them. Many of them will appeal to ministers
especially, and all charitably-disposed people,
to get them into positions for which they are often
wholly unqualified. They will ask you to aid them
with money; borrow or beg without any sensibility
of its unmanliness whatever. It takes a very large
part of every minister’s time to respond to these
incessant calls for “help.”</p>

<p>It would take reams of paper to write all the
supplications, petitions, and applications for positions,
when the applicants for aid should present
themselves in person and ask for posts, conscious
of their own ability to sustain themselves. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
Scotchman in Rangoon, whom I knew, and a man
with most kindly heart, in a position where he was
often besieged for employment, grew so tired of
this unmanly method of applying for employment,
that he became annoyed every time he saw a man
with one of those letters of recommendation coming
to him. He warned me repeatedly that, as a
minister, I ought not to write these letters of recommendation
to business men, and in later years
I ceased to do so. One constant form of this appeal
for some special favor has been repeatedly to
approach the Indian Government to retain certain
positions for the special benefit of this community.
The Anglo-Indian and Eurasian associations have
repeatedly memorialized the viceroy to order these
favors. Lord Curzon, the present viceroy, gave
their memorials special attention, and as a result
he delivered a reply of the most searching kind,
and urged the people of this community to carve
out something worthy themselves, instead of being
continually memorializing for special favors, and
refused to aid in the special class regulations. The
delegation retired, “thanking his excellency for
his sarcastic remarks.” Yet I fear it will take more
sarcasm before the right mettle is put into this
people, as a class.</p>

<p>Now while I have written these facts as I see
them, I wish to avoid absolutely a mistake commonly
made. While we point out these weaknesses
in a community, we must not stop there, as the
manner of some is. There are those who would
not allow themselves to speak of the real worthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
ones among these peoples as heartily as they would
of the deficiencies of others. I want to be fair and
to lean in statement where my sympathies have
always been, with the better and noble characteristics
of these unfortunate people, as I have known
and valued them, and recognize the possibility of
toning up the moral fiber, if they are taken in
hand as boys and girls before being confirmed in
the weakening customs of the country.</p>

<p>The youth, both boys and girls, of these families
have many among them who will take a fine
education. They do excellent work in school.
Some take a university course. A greater number
ought to do so. They make very good clerks
where nothing but writing is to be done. This has
been the chief employment of the men hitherto.
They are very fair teachers. A few have been employed
in our mission, who for painstaking care
and faithfulness can not be excelled. Some of them
have been inspired to be and do all that is worthy
and noble. There are missionaries from among
these peoples whose ministry has been blessed of
God, and greatly edified the Church. It is a fact,
however, that for the last dozen years there has
been almost a dearth of such applicants for admission
to our ranks. It is also true that the falling
off in these applications corresponds nearly
with the time that those who were in our Indian
Conferences were advanced to the full status of
American-trained missionaries. Let this be pondered
and remedied. Some of the young people
have done nobly. A few have honored themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
and the Church by an education in America, and
returned to devoted service for their own people.
But happily we have an illustrious soul of this community,
recently translated, whose going has made
earth poorer, except in hallowed memories of her
sainted life, and heaven richer. When we meet one
such soul as the sainted Phœbe Rowe, we lift up
our hearts with thanks to Him who has made the
Christ-life so real in flesh that we could look upon.
Phœbe Rowe was a Eurasian. She had all the
Indian conditions, but from very early life she was
a devoted Christian. In riper years she developed
Christian graces to the highest possibility. After
a notable service in many capacities, she closed her
career by a long term of service as an evangelist
to the poor native Church of India. Her life and
labors have been recorded, and are the property
of the Church. I only write to say of her that she
was the most perfect fruit of our Indian Mission.
Bishop Thoburn, in his address before the Central
Conference in 1900, spoke of her departure, and
said, “Phœbe Rowe, the most peerless saint I have
ever known.” One such saint is a prophecy of all
possible good among these people.</p>

<p>The climate and social conditions do affect Europeans
also. This is manifest in very many ways.
From having servants to do the necessary work
for them, they easily drift into the habit of leaning
back in an easy-chair, and calling “boy” for everything
they want, from a drink of water to a toothpick.
I saw an extreme case. A young Scotchman,
just out of the office in the evening, went to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
the Royal Lakes and called for his boat. His servant
dutifully brought it to the low platform; waiting
the pleasure of his master. The young man
turned him slowly round and sat down in the boat,
but left his legs stretched on the platform. The
servant went out and lifted one leg in, and the
other leg likewise. When the whole man was in
he pushed the boat off the shore, and the master
took lazily to the oars!</p>

<p>The habit of being waited upon in everything
tends to develop the domineering habit among almost
all people. Little children often fairly drive
the servants about as they assert their pettishness.
Grown-up people often act as spoiled children in
the same way. A young man who comes from
Europe from conditions where he had to do every
kind of work himself, soon learns to order his servants
around with more pomp than any born lord.
The tendency of this kind trends also to extravagance
in living. It is so common for men getting
a good salary to live beyond their means. It is a
common thing when an officer on good salary dies,
for his friends to take up a public subscription for
his widow, who will often be found to be without
support of any kind.</p>

<p>In these respects, the climate and the environment
are seductive. The sterling simplicity that
makes Westerners great is easily frittered away in
the East. Men go in for display. They keep what
they call “establishments.” They are much given
to drink. Too often they debauch. It is certain
that a young man runs far more risk in this tropical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
climate of making moral shipwreck than in Europe
or America. Take away his moral props with
which he is surrounded at home, and he quickly
forms alliances to his own heart. Concubinage is
very common. At first the youth is ashamed of
this relation, but later he is likely to flaunt this
sin in the face of all men. He sometimes acts as
if he were perfectly reckless of moral consequences.
The good name he brought to the country and his
own loved ones at home are forgotten. It is a
common saying, “He left his morals at the Suez
Canal.”</p>

<p>But while this is true as a tendency, it is the
joy of the writer to emphasize the fact that not a
few men, young men, come from Europe to the
tropics and keep themselves pure and noble in the
midst of all that is seductive in climate or society.
I have known a goodly number of such, and count
them among the most genuinely noble men that
I have met. There are men of many years in the
country whose moral worth has grown with a
steady growth as the years have gone forward, and
have made themselves a name that is a rebuke to
every dishonorable or unclean life, and a tower of
strength for themselves, and a mighty bulwark
against popular evils that degrade their fellow-countrymen.
These men, with their time, business
sense, and their money, are always actively on the
side of right and righteousness. No people have
had more such friendships in India than the Methodist
missionaries. I have been specially honored
with a wide acquaintance with such noble men.</p>

<span class="subhead">Characteristics of the Races of Burma</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> cosmopolitan character of the population
of Rangoon has been given, and it is only
necessary to add that all towns near the sea and on
the railways have the same intermingling of foreign
and native peoples. But there is a much
greater preponderance of those races which are at
home in Burma. As you go inland, of all the immigrants
the most ubiquitous is the Chinese.</p>

<p>The Burmese are easily the chief people of
Burma over any other race, native or immigrant,
in any part of Burma. Indeed, they rank high
among all peoples of Asia. I am aware that when
I exalt the Burman, I invite the criticism of the
champion of other races. It is a common observation
that missionaries especially come to champion
the worth and virtues of the peoples among
whom they labor, and perhaps estimate them above
their value, as compared with other races. This
trait is worth something to the world in that it
brings to the front one class of optimists of the
value of men as they are, or of what they shall be.
When any man loses faith in any race, he can no
longer be of signal service to that race.</p>

<p>In rating the Burmese people highly, I am not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
aware of being prejudiced in their favor by reason
of exclusive association. Our mission work has
brought us into contact with nearly all the races in
Burma. As a result of our experience, the Burman
must be given a place second to none. Personally,
I believe he has more to be said in his favor than
any other Asiatic race of which I have any knowledge.</p>

<p>I know it will be said that he is lazy and unreliable.
The former accusation is well-nigh universal.
To undertake even to qualify this charge of
indolence is a large task; but still I am ready to
say something for the Burman’s industry. It is
admitted that several of the races of India are
ploddingly industrious. The Burman’s industry is
less continuous, but I think not less genuine. He
has more festivals and idle days, but he certainly
works rapidly, and for long hours, when he works.</p>

<p>This is especially true of the cultivator. He is
in the field a little after daylight, and with only a
short time of rest at midday he works on till dark.
In harvesting time he does the same. One evening
when darkness had fallen I was going up a tidal
creek in a boat making my way to the village of
Naunguyi, when my attention was attracted by
sounds on the bank, and looking up I could see
outlined against the sky two Burmans loading a
cart with rice sheaves. It would have been too
dark to see them if we had all been on a level.
These men had been working since daylight. During
the threshing time the work is often kept
going on the threshing floors till midnight. Now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
I am persuaded that men naturally indolent do not
work in this way. In clerkships, and as subordinate
officials, they do not compare unfavorably
with other Asiatic races; while the Burmese women
are notably industrious, whether in the village, or
in the bazar in the cities.</p>

<p>Eight or ten years ago we heard much of the
hard-working, money-loving Madrassi supplanting
the Burmese land-owner and cultivator of Lower
Burma. But with a somewhat close observation
I am convinced he is not succeeding in this much
faster than the Burman finds it to his own advantage
to allow the black man from across the Bay
of Bengal to succeed him. The same thing is true
if it comes to larger trading. In such lines as the
Burman cares to enter, he gives a good account of
himself. If there is one man who will beat him
in trade, that man is the Chinaman. There are
certain kinds of employment the Burman dislikes,
and he avoids them; but in his chosen lines he is
not discounted by comparison.</p>

<p>The Burmese are racially very proud. There
is a good deal of dignity in this pride, as well as
of less worthy elements. Among themselves the
Burmese have no caste system, except that of the
pagoda slave, hence all kinds of work are honorable.
But when the Indian, with his caste system,
comes in and classifies life into the infinitesimal
distinctions of respectability, and the reverse in all
kinds of work whereby all domestic service is put
under this caste system, the proud Burman refuses
to be a servant! Who can blame him? He is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
standing protest against a system that is wholly
wrong. In Upper Burma, where he is not so much
in competition with the caste man, he takes fairly
well to all manner of work.</p>

<p>Even when he competes with the coolie labor
of other races he maintains himself. This was
strikingly illustrated in cutting the new road up
Thandaung three years ago. The officers tried
Karen labor till it failed, though the work was in
their own hills. Then the Madrassis were brought
in, and they gave way after repeated trials. Then,
as a last resort, the Burmese coolies came and
completed what the other races had failed to accomplish.</p>

<p>It is certainly true that the Burmese race is
much respected by most Europeans. I do not
think any other Asiatic race is equally respected
by foreigners resident in Burma.</p>

<p>The manners of the Burmese are pleasant. The
Burman is a friendly man, and approachable.
There is none of the exclusive, non-communicative
characteristics about him. He will share his house
and his food with you always. His religion, while
having something of bigotry in it, as almost all
religions have, is not offensive to men of other
faiths. The toleration by Buddhism of other faiths,
perhaps more apparent than real, yet is sufficient
to attract much favorable comment in Burma.</p>

<p>One fact much to the Burman’s credit, in comparison
with the other races of Asia, is his ability
to read; that is, a very large majority of the men
read, at least to some extent, and a good many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
women. Lately in America we have heard the
school system of the Chinese much lauded. And
since Minister Wu, at Washington, has so distinguished
himself and his race by his striking addresses,
many people have jumped at the conclusion
that an ignorant Chinaman is the exception.
But I am told by those who ought to know, that
in China only about one man in a hundred, and
one woman in ten thousand, can read. The Japanese
alone of Asiatic races are more literary than
the Burmese.</p>

<p>The Burman is peculiarly proud of his knowledge
of the Buddhist doctrines. He calls them the
“law.” In consequence of the system of doctrine
he upholds, he is unwilling to be taught religion
by a man whom he has hitherto believed incompetent
to teach. It is this, I believe, which makes
him unwilling, as a rule, to be taught Christianity
by a Karen. All his racial and religious pride
comes up as he faces the suggestion of the Karen
teaching him, whom he would always regard in a
peculiar way as a “son of the jungle.” He knows
the Karen formerly had no social standing and
no written language, while his vague demonology
was wholly wanting as a system of religious teaching.
No, he is not ready to receive Christianity
from the Karen.</p>

<p>For hundreds of years the Burmese have been
the dominant people in the land of Burma, and the
Shans, Chins, and Karens were conquered and
dominated by them. They have had some able
rulers, and at times have had a strong enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
government to wage war with distant people; even
with China herself they were often at war.</p>

<figure id="i_127" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 22em;">
  <img src="images/i_127.jpg" width="1173" height="1839" alt=" ">
    <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Burmese Family</span>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The Burmese have a distinctly developed racial
type. They, like all peoples in Burma, China, and
Siam, are of the Mongolian type of men. Their
complexion is much lighter than most Indian peoples,
and they naturally look upon the black man
from across the Bay of Bengal as the “Kalla,” dark
of color and an inferior. While they have distinct
racial features, they evidently are a blending of
the Chinese and the Malay. This has been noticed
particularly by comparison between the Burmese
and the Filipinos. Visitors to Manila, who are
acquainted with the Burmese, say the resemblance
to the Filipino is very striking. We know the
Filipino has a Chinese and Malay infusion of blood.</p>

<p>The more than six millions of Burmese people
are the chief people of this land, whether studied
from a governmental, racial, or missionary point
of view. To the American interested in missions
it is of special importance to remember these people.
In America there is just now much interest
in carrying the gospel to eight or ten millions of
people in the Philippine Islands. This interest is
largely because they are under the American flag.
Let not the millions of Burmese Buddhists be forgotten
while hastening to new fields.</p>

<p>The Shans take second rank among the races
of Burma, though much more attention has been
given to the Karens by the missionaries. The
Shans in appearance are the most like the Chinese
of any of the inhabitants of Burma. They are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
racially closely related to them. Their language,
appearance, and dress bear out the resemblance.</p>

<p>The Shans are found widely distributed in
Burma; but they live chiefly in the hills in the
northeast of the province. Like the Chins,
Kachins, and several tribes of the Karens, they
seem to prefer residence in the hills. In this they
all contrast with the Burmese, who always prefer
a home on the plains, and they are never for a long
time or in large numbers resident in the hills in
any part of Burma. The plains are the richest
part of the country, and as the conquering Burmese
came down from the north they naturally
occupied the fertile portions of the country, and
have remained there, the weaker peoples taking to
the hills and finding their permanent home in places
relatively difficult of access and easy of defense.</p>

<p>The Shans are a strong race, and a little taller
than either the Burmese or the Karens. They are
raisers of cattle and ponies, and are great traders,
bringing the products of the distant hills to the
railway centers.</p>

<p>In religion the Shans are Buddhists. They have
a written language, and the Bible has been translated
into their tongue by the Baptist missionaries.</p>

<p>In matters of moral purity the Shans must be
rated very low. By those best informed, it is said
that their girls are nearly all corrupted before they
are grown. A missionary resident among them
for years, told me that the principal chief had in
his reception room a picture portraying all the
vices known to the human race, placed on the wall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
in plain view of every one who came to see him.
Here men, women, and children, when calling on
the chief, looked upon this horrible picture, and
discussed it as a commonplace affair.</p>

<p>The missionary, who was the chief physician,
told him he would not come to his house again if
he did not take that picture down from his walls.
The chief expressed surprise, and readily agreed
to take the picture away, and explained that he did
not know it was wrong to have it there. “Did not
know it was wrong!” Can any one regard this
absence of the moral sense among an entire people,
and not believe in the need of Christian missions?
The hundreds of thousands of Shans must be included
in the plans for the evangelization of Burma.</p>

<p>The Karens are a distinct people, but of a number
of different tribes or divisions. During Burmese
domination they were very much oppressed.
For the most part they lived in villages apart from
the Burmese. Many of them lived far back in the
hills, probably for better security, and certainly for
freedom from interference on the part of the Burmese.
Owing to this exclusive village life for long
ages they have become very clannish. The Karen,
while admitting that the Burman is the superior
man, still preserves his racial pride. His village is
very dear to him. Unlike the Burman, who moves
annually or monthly, if it suits him, and seems
about as much at home in one place as another,
the Karen does not easily become dislodged from
the village where he was born. Lately there has
been some migration from the hills to the richer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
plains, but still the community life seems to be
pretty well preserved.</p>

<p>This village life has its advantages and disadvantages.
The cultivation of rice is made in a
community. While each man has the field which
he clears, it is so ordered that no one in the village
is left entirely destitute. The land has been held
as a village, and is therefore not easily alienated.
The area belonging to a given village is great,
especially in the hills, but the amount cultivated is
very little.</p>

<p>The style of cultivation, if indeed it should be
dignified by that name, is unique, and will never
be adopted by a people of advanced methods of
agriculture. The hills are heavily wooded, and
when a suitable area is selected for the next year’s
cultivation, the whole village proceeds to cut it
down with the most complete destruction. After
the forest is felled during the dry season it becomes
very dry, and just before the rain fire is
touched to it, and the flames with a terrific rush
cover the entire clearing in a few moments, and
consume nearly every stick of wood. The few logs
which remain are collected and burned, and with
the beginning of the rain the rice is planted on the
steep hillsides, the earth being enriched by a heavy
coat of fresh ashes. The ground is not plowed,
but the grain is dropped into small cuttings made
by the thrust of a small spade-like iron on the end
of a long handle. The sprouts that spring from
the roots in the ground are cut away as the rice
grows. The harvesting is with the sickle, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
when threshed is carried to the village, frequently
a long distance away, on the backs of men and
heads of women, the latter carrying the larger
loads, as is usual in the East. This is most laborious
and tedious. As there are only mountain
paths, and as the Karen, even when well to do,
does not care for road improvements, he climbs
up and down as his fathers have done before him
for hundreds of years.</p>

<p>As the soil is never cultivated, they depend on
the fresh ashes to force their crop. This requires
a fresh clearing every year, while a new jungle
growth springs up on the last year’s field. They
do not wish to cut the jungle oftener than once
in ten years. It will be seen how wasteful is this
strange method of cultivation. How wonderful
the forest growth that will maintain itself over all
these hills under such destructive treatment!</p>

<p>The Christian Karens are a living miracle of
the century of Christian missions. They need
much teaching yet; but when one sees these people
so uplifted from the state they were once in, be
what he may, he must believe in Christian missions.
The Baptists, under God, deserve nearly
all the credit for the conversion of this people.</p>

<p>The Karen, as a man, is a study. He is affectionate,
especially toward his missionary. Yet he
will often be guilty of conduct quite at variance
with that sentiment. Yet of this conduct he will
repent again soon; but it is a repentance usually
without tears or apparent sense of regret. He will
take offense easily, and a little later reappear with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
a smile on his face, as forgetful of his recent temper
as a child. But he is not a child. He enjoys
a joke, even at his own expense. He is also a very
obstinate man, even when his obstinacy is against
all his own interests.</p>

<p>But if you would see the Karen at his best, go
to his village and see his children in school, a
school which the missionary founded, but which
the village now supports. Remember the missionary
gave this people their written language.
Attend the evening prayers when the village pastor
leads their devotions in their simple chapel.
Hear them sing! There is probably no more inspiring
singing in the world. You will want to
hear them again. Go to church on Sunday, and
hear a sermon by a trained preacher, whose great-grandfather
worshiped “gnats” or demons, who
he supposed inhabited the surrounding hills and
had his life in their malevolent control. How great
is the distance from the demon-worshiper to the
intelligent and devout Christian! The missionary
was the human agent, and God the author of this
transformation through the preaching of the gospel.
Yet some people would say they do not believe
in missions!</p>

<p>The Chins and Kachins inhabit the hills of North
and Northeast Burma. They are kindred peoples.
There are possibly two hundred thousand of them.
Like other isolated people, they have everything
to learn from civilization and the Christian religion.
The Government officer and the missionary have
undertaken the problem of these people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span></p>

<p>The Chins have given much trouble to the
Government within the last few years. They lived
formerly by raiding the peaceful people of the
plains. When the English Government annexed
Upper Burma, it punished them for this. Soon the
whole hill country rose against the Government.
A band of soldiers was dispatched into the hills
to subdue them. After some sharp fighting they
sued for peace, promising good behavior. Sir
Alexander MacKenzie, the efficient chief commissioner,
was then the head of the province of Burma.
He instructed Mr. Cary, the political officer of the
Chin Hills, to bring several Chin chiefs to Rangoon
to see the city and the emblems of authority
and power of the Government. His idea was that
if these savage mountainmen saw the power of
the Government they would be induced to keep the
peace. He treated them kindly, but told them
they must respect their neighbor’s property and
obey the Government. But this wholesome exhortation
of the chief provincial officer of the great
Indian Empire was wholly lost on these daring,
but ignorant, men of the hills. Their whole life
ran riot over all obligations recognized by civilized
men. Almost immediately they began again to
rob and kill. This time they were more severely
punished. Their villages were burned and they
were defeated in any attempt to give battle, though
the punitive force, almost all of native soldiery,
under the energetic and capable political officer,
Mr. Cary, was very small. They were fined fifteen
hundred guns. Of course, they protested they did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
not have three hundred. But under pressure they
surrendered the required number.</p>

<p>Here was a revelation! Every antiquated gun
of Europe, of fifty or one hundred years ago, had
been brought by unscrupulous traders and sold
to these wild tribes! The sales had not been made
recently, it is true; but nevertheless the only firearms
these wild men had they had secured probably
of British traders of earlier years, who disposed
of them along the coast and they had been
carried inland, where years afterward they were
used in armed robberies of peaceful subjects of
this empire and against British authority. Some
so-called civilized men sacrifice much of civilization
for a little gain in trade.</p>

<p>After the country was substantially disarmed,
a large number of these chiefs were brought to
Rangoon by Mr. Cary to attend a more imposing
display of the greatness of the Government. On
this occasion the viceroy summoned them and
their official head, Mr. Cary.</p>

<p>The viceroy is appointed for five years, and
usually once in his term he visits Burma. Lord
Landsdowne was the viceroy, and held a <i>durbar</i>,
an official reception, attended by all officials and
the general public. At this durbar he recognized
the eminent service of Mr. Cary, and decorated
him before the great assembly. His excellency
also called forward these Chin chiefs, and gave
each a beautifully ornamented large knife, as a
token of his good will. He probably could not
have given any present so highly valued. Most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
half-civilized men live with their knives in their
hands.</p>

<p>At this time a touching incident occurred which
ought to be perpetually remembered to the credit
of a brave and unselfish officer. Mr. Cary was
the honored guest at the quarters of the chief
secretary of government. The Chin chiefs were
camped at the Royal Lakes, living in their usual
uncivilized manner. They probably were eating
more than they ever had eaten before in their
lives. At any rate, cholera broke out among them.
On receiving report of their distress, Mr. Cary left
his comfortable quarters and the society of his
superior officers, and went into the camp of these
chiefs and nursed the sick and dying. Some of
them died in his arms. The cholera is the worst
epidemic of the East, and most to be dreaded. Yet
this brave man risked his life to nurse these wild
men, who had been, until very recently, trying their
hardest to kill him. It is such heroism as this on
the part of British officers that makes the British
rule great throughout the world. They stop at no
sacrifice of their own lives to put turbulent countries
in order, and then are no less heroic in times
of peace in serving their high trust of poor and
dependent people.</p>

<p>I rode all day with Mr. Cary and his fifty wild
chiefs on their homeward journey. I was greatly
interested in the story of the pacification of all
that Chin and Lushai country, of which he had
the management. I was surprised that Mr. Cary
attributed his practical ability in all his arduous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
labors to the drill he received on an American
farm and as a cowboy in the Northwest for four
years before going to Burma. Though an Englishman,
he had spent these years in America.</p>

<p>The Karens, Chins, and Kachins are being rapidly
converted to the Buddhist religion. Christianity
and Buddhism are in an unconscious race
to win them to one or the other of these faiths.
The first to reach them will win them to its system
of religious teaching.</p>

<span class="subhead">Buddhism</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Burma</span> is a land of Buddhism and pagodas.
The pagodas are the shrines of the Buddhists.
They are found all over Burma in almost
countless numbers, in every condition from the
newly-completed to the decayed structure. On
the higher hills and mountains they are usually
built on the most conspicuous spurs, where they
can be seen to best effect from all the region
round about. In the low hills the same principle
is followed, the most conspicuous place being selected.
On the flat plains among the rice fields
they make artificial mounds, to serve as the site of
their temples to be placed thereon.</p>

<p>In the Buddhistic system of religion the building
of pagodas is accounted one of the chief works
of merit. Their preservation is of little consequence,
so that the country is dotted all over with
multitudes of abandoned pagodas, overgrown with
jungle and in all stages of decay. You can scarcely
dig into any old mound anywhere in Burma without
finding the brick outlines of some ancient
pagoda.</p>

<p>Pagodas are all always built after one pattern.
This pattern allows of a structure not higher than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
a man originally, being enlarged to the size of the
Great Pagoda at Rangoon without change of architectural
plan. In this respect the pagoda is probably
the only style of building ever planned by
man that has been commonly adopted, in which
this structural possibility is found. The pattern is
that of an irregular cone built of brick and earth,
most commonly of brick, with the outer surface
plastered. At the base is a little cavity, in which
some precious relic is placed, and over this rises
the solid structure of the pagoda. The base is
usually circular, and the superstructure retains the
same shape, excepting that it curves irregularly
to smaller circles. The top is always finished with
an umbrella-like structure often with rings suspended
from its outer rim. The rims of the umbrellas
are usually made of some kind of metal,
from which are suspended a great number of bells.
The bells are usually rung by a brass imitation of
the leaf of the peepul-tree, the sacred tree of Buddhism.
This leaf is loosely, suspended alongside of
the bell, and as the gentle breeze peculiar to the
tropics, especially Burma, puts them in motion,
they gently tap the exterior of the bells. You are
likely to be charmed with the delicate melodies of
the bells until you come to feel what a hollow,
comfortless system Buddhism is. A pagoda is a
tomb, or at least a receptacle of relics of some
revered personage. The ashes of a priest’s body
that has been cremated are often put into a pagoda.
Reputed remains of Gautama are, of course, the
most valued. However extravagant the fiction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
that surrounds these cherished objects, the credulous
Burman professes to believe in them absolutely.
This is conspicuously true of the great
temple at Candy in Ceylon, and the great Sway
Dagon Pagoda of Rangoon. The managers of
the former profess to have in their possession one
of Gautama’s eyeteeth, which is shown to pious,
or noted visitors. A story is invented accounting
for the disappearance of three of these useful dentine
members, but the fourth and only possible
one, not accounted for otherwise, has found its way
by the traditional route to the temple of Candy.
It is there the object of great reverence, and pilgrimages,
often from long distances, are made to
this shrine in order to look upon and worship this
tooth. That which is shown as the eyetooth of
Gautama is a piece of bone about two inches long,
and half an inch thick. It is as large as the tooth
of a horse, and could not by any possibility ever
have been one of any man’s set of teeth. It is in
appearance much like a piece of smoked ivory.
Yet this piece of bone is reverenced to a degree
that perhaps no other relic of Buddhist tradition
possesses. After making great offerings to their
own pagodas, the Burmese, two years ago, made a
beautiful golden casket and sent a pretentious commission
to Candy with this casket, the gift of the
Burmese Buddhists, as the permanent receptacle
of this much-lauded tooth.</p>

<p>That which makes the great Sway Dagon Pagoda
famous above all others, is that it contains
relics of Gautama. The story is that Burmese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
merchants made their way to India, while Gautama
was alive, and becoming converts of his
teachings, or system of belief, they were about to
return to Burma, when Gautama gave them some
relics of his person, saying that while they kept
these relics they would observe his system of
doctrine. He then tore off a small piece of his
priestly robe, gave them his simple begging bowl,
and pulled eight hairs out of his head, and gave
them these also as keepsakes and reminders of
his teaching. These gifts they brought back to
Burma, and over them erected a small pagoda,
which formed the original portion of the present
great structure that has become so far famed in
the Buddhist world. The original structure must
have been as insignificant as many that are seen
elsewhere. But as time went on, and the invention,
for it could have been nothing else as in the
case of the eyetooth at Candy, was accepted, the
pagoda became more and more famous, and its
size was increased until its present dimensions
were reached. It is now 1,350 feet round its base,
and rises to the towering height of 328 feet. Its
height is exceeded only by the pagoda at Pegu,
but its general dimensions are far greater than the
latter, and its fame has no rival. Reliable accounts
of the time of building the original pagoda are
wanting. But it is pretty certain that its present
dimensions were reached some five hundred years
ago. I have been unable to learn when it was first
covered with gold leaf.</p>

    <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Shrine, Sway Dagon Pagoda</span>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The structure of this pagoda has many other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
important features. Round its base are found
many forms of elephants, and small pagodas that
fairly line the lower circle. There are four shrines
at the cardinal points of the compass. It will have
been noted that the pagoda, unlike all other designs
of sacred buildings given to worship, has no
interior chamber. Excepting the small cavity
given to the relic, there is solid masonry throughout
the vast structure. But the most striking display
of the pagoda is its covering of gold leaf.
From base to top every inch is covered with this
golden coat. The devout Buddhists are always
renewing this gilding. No provision is made to
prevent the rains that beat upon the pagoda for
six months of each year from washing away this
golden covering. Its rusty appearance on any part
simply calls for more offerings for more regilding,
by which the devout Buddhist expects to gain
much merit. I have been unable to learn the cost
of gilding the exterior, though it must be very
great. The pagoda is regilded about twice in ten
years. It is difficult to determine the cost, as the
gilding is put on in patches. The renewal has
never been done systematically, but by piece-meal.
Besides this, the umbrella that crowns the pagoda
and its pendent rings are studded with precious
stones and jewelry to the value of two hundred and
fifty thousand dollars. The four shrines are ornamented
with hand-carving wrought out with great
pains and skill. There are two very large chests
near the entrance to the pagoda area, into which
all devout Buddhists visiting at this temple drop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
their offerings. These gifts are taken care of by
the trustees of the pagoda, and expended on its
maintenance. Round about the temple is an open
court, which would accommodate many thousands
of visitors, and ofttimes it is crowded to its fullest
capacity. On the outside of this court, and inside
the walls that make up the four sides of the
square known as pagoda hill, there is a grove of
palms and peepul-trees. The latter is the sacred
tree of Buddhism, and it is usually found wherever
pagodas have been built. Underneath these trees,
and entirely surrounding the pagoda inclosure,
there are many large pavilions, most of them open
to all comers, where images of Gautama are numbered
by the hundreds. A few images of Gautama
are in closed structures behind glass and iron bars.
Other symbols of the Buddha or his teaching are
there also; but images of Gautama are by far the
most numerous. Gautama is represented as reclining
on his right side, with his head supported
by his hand; as sitting, which is the accepted position;
and standing. These are three chosen attitudes.
These three postures are all that are commonly
used. The images are made of brass, of
marble, and of alabaster. Some of them are of the
normal size of a man, and some of them are many
times larger, but all bear the impassive features
of a man absorbed in meditation. These images
always bear distinctly Burmanized features.</p>

<p>There are also great bells about the Sway
Dagon Pagoda. The larger bells are supported
on great wooden beams, and are rung by all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
worshipers, and even by the idle passer-by. But
the strange thing about all this area of the pagoda
is that it is open to all peoples, and no objects
except the inclosed images are protected in any
way. This is not true of either Mohammedan
mosques or Hindu temples. All Buddhists take
off their shoes or sandals before going up the steps.
And if any Asiatic should attempt to go up the
stairs with shoes on, he would be ordered to
make bare his feet. Europeans are not so restricted.
But this appears to be the only special
requirement for admission to the pagoda area. So
it comes to pass that the devout Buddhist strikes
the great bells with the wooden beam, or horns of
an elk that are kept for that purpose, and the next
passer-by may be an idle globe-trotter, who strikes
the bell to only test the melody of its sound.</p>

<p>Worship at a pagoda is a study. The idea of
worship in Buddhism differs so widely from that
of any other religion, that it makes the student of
comparative religions pause with astonishment.
Buddhism is very much a religion of negations at
best. There is little that is positive in it. There
is no God according to pure Buddhism. It does
not teach an unending personal immortality. The
character of existence beyond death is believed to
be through various transmigrations of beasts,
demons, and elevated spirits to final extinction of
personal existence in <i>Nirvana</i>. Continued existence
is considered a calamity. To extinguish personality
in <i>Nirvana</i> is the supreme goal. In that
loss of personal identity man passes from under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
the necessity of being reborn. In all the struggle
in which man is engaged he has no aid from without
himself. His own meritorious acts must bring
him through all lower existences, and finally drop
him into the oblivion of <i>neikban</i>. Before men can
reach this goal, they must have passed through
myriads of existences, many of these lives being
spent in hells filled with all tortures. The hells of
Buddhism are filled with terrors measured only
by the wildest imagination, lasting through millions
of years. Buddhism is a system in which
there is no God to hear a prayer or speak a consoling
word. Then what is worship under such
a religion, if indeed it be a religion? The people
and the yellow-robed priests fill the spaces before
these several shrines, and there offer flowers and
food to the images of Gautama. Or they sit upon
their heels about the open court that surrounds
the pagoda, and offer their flowers toward the
pagoda, lifting them toward the top of the gilded
dome, while they laud the great teacher of Buddhism.
In none of these acts is there any real
prayer. There is no confessing of sin or need, nor
hope even that Gautama can hear, as he is supposed
to have ascended to <i>Nirvana</i> and to have
attained to annihilation of conscious self. The
whole of their worship seems to be made up of
laudations of the name and character of Gautama,
and his law, and the Buddhist priesthood. All
worship consists in praise of an extinct personality
on the part of a man whose highest hope is to attain
unto like personal extinction! But in all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
dreary and weary struggle there is no eye to pity
and no hand to help to attain this goal of spiritual
suicide.</p>

<p>One of the incongruities about this great pagoda
I found in the fact that the watchmen are
Hindus. Perhaps no temple of non-Christians,
save that of Buddhists, is cared for by men of
other faiths. Christian Churches in Southern Asia
do often employ Hindus or Mohammedans to care
for them and act as collectors of their funds. But
none but Mohammedans go into a Mohammedan
mosque, and only Hindus enter a Hindu temple.
There sits a Mohammedan also inside the pagoda
area selling coffee and bread to all who wish to
buy. Bishop Thoburn once remarked that perhaps
only in Burma, and that at a Buddhist place of worship,
could such an incongruous sight be witnessed.</p>

<p>Another feature of the pagoda area is that at
its four sides, east, west, north, and south, it is
bounded by brick walls, rising four or five feet
above the pagoda area, and of several feet in thickness.
The Burmese fortified the pagoda, and the
English have done likewise. At the base is another
higher wall, and inside of this a moat. The English
soldiery guard the pagoda hill, and the ordnance
department of the British garrison stationed
at Rangoon is inside the outer wall on the west
of the pagoda. The guard is not seen about the
court. In the northeast corner of the pagoda area
are several graves of British officers and soldiers
who fell in storming that fortress in 1852. From<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
the southeast corner of the inclosure you see the
slope up which that band of soldiers charged, and
half down the hillside are a number of graves
which are unnamed, and around them a wall is
built. Here the common soldiers fell in that
charge. They died for “Greater England.”</p>

<p>From the pagoda wall you can get one of the
finest views in Lower Burma. To the south and
southeast lies the greater part of the city of Rangoon.
At the lower extremity of the city the Pegu
and Rangoon Rivers unite their ample breadth of
waters. The great rice mills line the river and its
larger tributaries, and lift their tall chimneys above
every other building of the city. To the left the
beautiful Royal Lakes reflect the tropical sunlight
in dazzling brightness, while to the northward the
sweep of vision includes many stately houses of
the residents of Kokine, the fashionable suburb
of the city.</p>

<span class="subhead">Buddhism; How Maintained</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> hoary system of Buddhism must have
some elements of vitality to keep it in existence
through the twenty-six centuries of its history.
That it has long since passed the stage of
its greatest power is quite easily believed. That
such a system could remain the religion of progressive
races under the light of the present and
the future, as indicated by the present, few will
maintain. That the number of its present adherents
has been greatly exaggerated, there is no
doubt. Some of the peoples which have been
classed as Buddhistic in religion are clearly not
distinctively of that faith.</p>

<p>Sir Monier Williams, in his great work on
Buddhism, says that of real Buddhists, who are
not more identified with some other religion than
with it, number not over one hundred millions of
adherents, instead of five hundred millions, as
some have claimed. He declares that Christianity,
and not Buddhism, is the strongest religion numerically
in the world.</p>

<p>But a religion with even one hundred millions
of reasonably faithful adherents of its doctrines
and practices demands our respectful study. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
is not possible within the limits here defined for
the writer to discuss the many-sidedness of Buddhism,
for all the elements of a faith must have
consideration in an attempt to set it forth comprehensively.
It is the writer’s intention merely
to outline some features of Buddhism most apparent
to a missionary whose work lies in a Buddhist
country. Buddhism is said to be in its purest form
in Burma and Ceylon.</p>

<p>A few general statements may be made. Buddhism
never claimed to be divine in its origin.
It was originally entirely atheistic. It is hardly
entitled to be called a religion. It is the most
pessimistic philosophy ever taught among men,
or even conceived as yet, by any teacher. It inveighs
against all natural desires or emotions however
exalted, and disallows the holiest relationship.
Society itself could not exist if the fundamental
teachings of Buddhism were observed. All
innocent joys are prohibited among those who
would attain to <i>Nirvana</i>. It makes self-destruction
the highest aim of man. To cease to be born, and
to extinguish personal consciousness, is set before
its followers as the final goal to be sought. How
can such a system, so opposed to all that men love,
find millions of adherents?</p>

<p>There certainly is a fascination about the supreme
renunciation in the system. Gautama certainly
renounced much; and doubtless many of
his followers have made such a sacrifice of desires
as he. It is not here maintained that this renunciation
is wholly unselfish, but that it lies at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
foundation of Buddhism; and however unhealthful
a sentiment it is, it has always appealed to many
minds. Those who will not make such renunciations
themselves revere those who do, and help
sustain a system that teaches such tenets.</p>

<p>Another source of the power of Buddhism is
found in the system of doctrine taught. It is all
the stronger in that, as a system, it is connected
with a great teacher. It is true that Buddhism
has more in it which Gautama did not teach, than
of that which he did teach. But it is very easy for
the Buddhist to connect any teaching of his religion
directly with his idea of Gautama. When a
religion with a system of doctrine meets with the
nebulous beliefs and incoherent practices of
demonology, or like beliefs, it must steadily gain
adherents. Buddhism has a literature of much
importance. To have sacred books, which can be
appealed to in support of the voice of the living
preacher, or teacher, is a great source of power.
We see in Burma that the more backward races
are becoming Burmanized and converted to the
Buddhist religion. When they have become Buddhists,
as in the case of Karens, it is the testimony
of all missionaries that they are much more difficult
to convert to Christianity. This Buddhist
“law” is one of the three objects of reverence, or
worship, enjoined by Gautama.</p>

<p>Gautama exalted the brotherhood of monks.
They have become one of the three objects of
veneration. Dressed in their yellow robes and
admitted to the monastic order, they are thereby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
exalted in the minds of Buddhists far above the
ordinary man. So much so, that in all addresses
to them the highest terms of honor are used.
On some occasions they are actually worshiped.
When a monk, or <i>poungyi</i>, leaves the assembly of
monks, which is frequently the case, he at once
drops to the level of the ordinary man. But while
he is a member of the order, he is regarded as a
superior, worthy of all reverence even by his own
family. These monks, with their yellow robes and
beads and boy attendants, are everywhere, except
at weddings and festivals, though often gathering
in crowds a little apart from the latter. The daily
going forth with the begging bowl to receive the
food given by the devout, or even respectable laity,
is an object-lesson in Buddhism. The distinctive
buildings called <i>choungs</i>, in which the monks always
live, are found in every village; and whole blocks
of these buildings in all towns and cities proclaim
the teachers of Buddhism. These houses of the
monks are invariably the best buildings in the village.
This conspicuous advertisement of the
monastic teachers does much to keep the system
which they represent ever before the people in a
conspicuous way.</p>

<figure id="i_157" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 20em;">
  <img src="images/i_157.jpg" width="1169" height="2112" alt=" ">
    <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Buddhist Monk and Attendant</span>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But the monks do two distinctive services for
their faith of a more positive kind. They teach
practically every boy in Burma. They teach the
boys to read, and they indoctrinate them. No boy
is considered to have a human spirit at all. He
must remain an animal until he has spent at least
one day in the monastery. But aside from this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
approach to the sacred order of monks, all Burmese
boys attend school for some length of time,
and usually learn to read their language passably
well. They certainly learn the Buddhist doctrines.
So it comes to pass that most Burmese know what
they believe, however inconsistent with this belief
they live. They also learn the elements of arithmetic,
as well as the grotesque teachings of Buddhism
in geography of these teachers. In estimating
the strength of Buddhism, and its ability to
maintain itself, the monastic school, uniting a religious
order with the instruction of all the male
childhood and youth, stands easily first of all its
sources of power.</p>

<p>There are schools conducted by laymen in almost
every large village. These schools do not
generally have a continuous existence, but so long
as a teacher can get scholars he keeps his school
going. In these lay schools also some Buddhistic
instruction is imparted. So that the Buddhist
youth is the exception who has not been indoctrinated
with Buddhist teaching. Without knowing
why he is a Buddhist, nevertheless he proclaims
himself as a Buddhist, and will give a fair statement
of his belief. The missionary must bring his
message to a mind pre-empted by Buddhist doctrine
taught by the yellow-robed monk.</p>

<p>From this statement of the Buddhist school
system of the Burmese, and to its power as a religious
agency, the reader, as does the missionary,
will see the imperative need of Christian schools to
take the place of the Buddhist schools. Their efficiency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
as a missionary agency can not be over-estimated.
Each of the large missions now operating
in Burma has adopted this strategic agency
with very encouraging results. Many Buddhists
do not hesitate to send their boys to a mission
school if it is equipped to do superior work. Here,
then, is Christianity’s greatest opportunity among
the young. That mission will show greatest wisdom
which gives Christian schools of the higher
grades special attention.</p>

<p>There are doctrines of Buddhism, aside from the
moral precepts or regulations for the conduct or
belief of its adherents, which may be, all unconsciously
to the Buddhist, of great attraction.
Buddhism, as has been noted, like most other Eastern
philosophies, teaches that men pass through
many births through countless ages, and transmigration
through men, animals, and spirits. This
transmigration may be endless, and will be, if the
individual does not attain to <i>Nirvana</i>. Now, while
a man’s place in the scale of being is determined
by the conduct of the life that now is, there is
nothing final in this life as affecting destiny. If
he sinks in the scale of being, he can rise in the
same by his conduct in another existence. The
time taken to make his recovery from the consequences
of his demerits in this life may be ages;
still he can retain all that he has lost by a bad life
here. It therefore comports with men’s wish that
they can commit acts not wholly agreeable to the
known or believed rules of conduct, and yet they
believe they can escape after a long time the consequences<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
of such trifling with their moral code.
It is a pleasant belief of human nature, wishing
to indulge in that which is forbidden, to sacrifice
some future blessedness for a present gratification,
if at the same time the man can believe that the
loss may at some future time be recovered. To a
temporizing conscience this is a very comforting
doctrine.</p>

<p>Buddhism teaches that character and states of
existence are determined finally by a man’s unaided
efforts. Human nature in all lands takes kindly to
such teaching. If men could purchase salvation
at a price in payment or sacrifice of even life itself,
there would be many applicants for eternal life,
who will not receive it as a gift. Buddhism is very
complimentary to self-conceit when it teaches that
we need no God to enlighten us, no Savior to save
us, but that we can recover ourselves. That only
our own acts can affect our scale of being and ultimately
determine our destiny, in every varying
merit or demerit, is believed. Building and gilding
a pagoda lays up a great store of merit, and to engage
in meditation is the most meritorious work of
all. Their whole system of the merit of works
breeds inordinate conceit, and hence is a very
pleasant doctrine to men. To save themselves, and
not to be saved by the vicarious sacrifice of another,
is pleasing to pride. I think all agree that
this belief in self-acquired merit is one of the
strongest bulwarks of Buddhism.</p>

<p>The student of religion who looks for its effect
on the people, is at first perplexed at a singular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
paradox among the Burmese Buddhists. He finds
a religion that frowns upon the innocent joys of
life, and much more upon all spectacular demonstrations.
It especially discourages theatricals and
feasting. The natural effect of such a religion
would be to depress the spirit and overshadow the
life. It would pluck up all gayety from a people.
But we find the Burmese Buddhists the gayest
and most light-hearted race of the Orient. Their
religion to the contrary, they have more music,
dancing, and theatricals than any other people.
And in all this they regard themselves as the most
consistent Buddhists. They even connect a festival
with almost every special religious duty. It therefore
comes to pass that they harmonize festal joys
with the utter prohibition of them by their religion,
and count the practice and the “law” that interdicts
it equally “good.” By observing this fact, it is
clear that the drastic prohibitions of Buddhism
have no place at all in life practice. If, therefore,
this contradiction of Buddhism does not add to its
strength, it at least allows the adherent to accept
and reject such portions of the Buddhist law as
may be convenient, and as suits his fun-loving and
easy-going disposition. In this way the Burman
comforts himself with the belief that he is a devout
Buddhist, and at the same time escapes all the depressing
effects on his nature that would result if
he actually undertook to keep either the letter or
spirit of the Buddhist law. So it appears this paradox
is explained.</p>

</figure>

<p>Examples of their ability to turn any circumstance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
into a festival is seen at their funerals.
When an ordinary man dies the friends gather
and bring food, and keep up a several days’ feasting.
On the day of the funeral long lines of oxcarts
are drawn up, each with some offering for
the <i>poungyis</i>, or priests. These gifts to the priests
seem to be about the only religious part of the
ceremonies. Then with bands playing, and often
dancers and buffoons performing at the head of
the procession, they move away to the burial
ground. On several occasions I saw half-drunken
men carrying the coffin on a tall, loosely-constructed
framework, dancing with all their might
under their burden. Sometimes it seemed the
coffin would fall to the ground.</p>

<p>I have seen the burial of a Buddhist nun where
the procession contained sixty-one stands of presents,
one for each year of the nun’s life, carried in
front of the corpse. These presents were intended
for the priests, and they enabled the donors to
gain merit, make a show, and enjoy a festival all
in one. The presents were of plates, towels, and
carpets, amounting to about ten dollars a stand,
or over six hundred dollars in value in all. The
<i>poungyis</i> often preach against the festivals, but I
have never heard that they ever refused to receive
the presents, an indispensable feature of the display.</p>

<p>There are great festivals gotten up at the burning
of a priest who has been much venerated. He
may have enjoyed a reputation for great learning,
and perhaps lived to a good old age. The body is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
kept, if the priest should die in the rainy season,
until the dry weather brings a time suitable for
camping in the fields. Arrangements having been
completed, a place, usually a cleared rice field, is
selected, and booths are constructed to accommodate
the gathering people. Material is procured,
and a very large skeleton framework of dry poles
is constructed in imitation of the seven-fold roof
of a monastery. This framework is covered over
with matting and paper, on which is much ornament,
usually of a pictorial character. Great ropes
are drawn high up into the framework, where it
is designed the coffin shall be placed before the
burning. A procession is formed to bring the body
in great state, with all kinds of symbolical banners
and imitations of the sacred elephant. The casket
is placed on these great ropes, and skillfully drawn
into the tower of the structure. When the body is
once in its place, the younger men hastily take up
burning spears, as fire brands, and hurl them into
the combustible material, and in an instant all is
aflame. Soon there is nothing but ashes. The
camp is broken up, and the people return home.
They have had a great festival lasting in preparation
over many days, and have performed a pious
work of merit. They have violated much of Buddhist
teaching; but by their spectacular festival
they have helped to perpetuate Buddhism in the
community. I witnessed preparation for one such
burning near Rangoon. The firing of the pyre
occurred on Sunday, amidst a great throng of all
the nations represented in Burma. The full account<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
was given in the daily papers, and it is said
that thirty thousand dollars was spent in cremating
the one body, that of a noted monk. Recent word
from Mandalay tells of the cremation of the body
of the chief bishop of Buddhism in Burma. It is
said twenty thousand people were present at this
festival. Yet the bishop had always preached that
all festivity was wrong, and the whole Buddhist
people declared the “law” was good.</p>

<p>The same contradictions are apparent in their
theological teaching. One instance will suffice as
an illustration. Fish is a common and much appreciated
article of food in Burma, and has been
for centuries. The people have come to regard
fish as necessary to their food as rice. This creates
a great demand for fish, and consequently calls
for a multitude of fishermen. But by Buddhist
teaching the fishermen, or the hunter, is doomed
to the deepest hell for taking life. They teach that
there are four great hells, one below another, and
the fisherman is doomed to go to the bottom of
the lowest hell, and can not get out till he spends
fifty million years in each of the four hells. And
only after that could he hope to be born a man
again on earth. Meantime the well-fed Burman
who fattens on the fish, who made the fisherman
necessary, thinks he not only has no responsibility
for the other’s sin, but is making good headway
toward <i>Nirvana</i>! The fisherman, when interviewed,
is quite at ease. Question him of the sin
of taking the life of the fish, and he will confidently
tell you: “I do not kill the fish. I only drag it out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
of the water, and the hot sun kills it.” Both declare
themselves good Buddhists, and that “the
Buddhist law is good.” It leaves liberty enough
for any number of specious pleas to avoid personal
responsibility for violating the Buddhist prohibitions,
while the votaries of Buddhism are still
pretending to keep the “law.”</p>

<span class="subhead">Buddhism and Christianity Contrasted</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Comparative</span> religion is one of the most
fascinating studies. In Christian lands well-informed
people are ever ready to receive any new
light on any of the principal religions of the world.
In the East also there is inquiry after the tenets
of differing faiths. It is true the inquiry in the
Orient is confined to a few of the most advanced
minds, and it is also doubtful if the inquiry is often
fairly made. The disposition seems to be to assume,
to begin with, that some religion like Hinduism,
or Buddhism, is the religion of most truth,
and then to show that Christianity has some things
in common with these faiths. The deduction is
then easily drawn that one can be an eclectic in
religion. I have seen Europeans in the East who,
in an off-handed way, would say: “It is wrong to
try to convert the Burmese from their Buddhism
to Christianity. Their religion is better for them
than ours would be.” I have not heard such a
remark from any one who pretended to be a Christian
in any devout or spiritual sense. He would be
a Christian only in the sense that he belonged to
the European community, who are always called
“Christians” by those of other faiths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span></p>

<p>Buddhism has had much praise for its moral
precepts, and its general practice of total abstinence
from all alcoholic drinks. This prohibition
has been widely observed. It is probable that
Buddhism was the first religion to require total
abstinence. Then Buddhism gave woman a freedom
that no other religion of the East allows.
Contrasted with Hinduism or Mohammedanism
in this respect, Buddhism must be highly commended.
But it is another matter when men assume
that one religion is as good as another, or
estimate Buddhism as a religion of comfort and
light, when it has neither.</p>

<p>It is not the purpose of this book to attempt a
comprehensive statement of comparative religions,
much less a discussion of that idea. But it is my
purpose to set before the reader that wherein
Buddhism is contrasted with Christianity, believing
that Christianity, and it alone, satisfies the
wants of any human soul. I have desired to show
wherein Buddhism fails in all essential features
to measure up to this need of man for a perfect
religion. It is not intended to disparage any incidental
good that Buddhism may possess, but to
show the contrast with Christianity in its fundamental
teachings. In this I am not dependent on
my own research, but can accomplish my purpose
best by quoting from Sir Monier Williams. This
great scholar and author published his works
on Buddhism as a culmination of extended studies
in the great religions of the world. It is the ripest
fruit of his high scholarship. He published this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
work just a few years before he died. From his
chapter on “Buddhism Contrasted with Christianity”
I have quoted at length, believing his contrasts
are exhaustive and entirely truthful.</p>

<p>This eminent author doubts if Buddhism is a
religion at all. After postulating that every system
assuming to be a religion must declare the
existence of an eternal God, and the immortality
of the soul of man, he further declares that such a
system must satisfy four requisites:</p>

<p>“First. It must reveal the Creator in his nature
and attributes to his creature, man.</p>

<p>“Secondly. It must reveal man to himself. It
must impart to him a knowledge of his own nature
and history—what he is; why he was created;
whither he is tending; and whether he is at present
in a state of decadence downwards from a higher
condition, or of development upwards from a
lower.</p>

<p>“Thirdly. It must reveal some method by which
the finite creature may communicate with the infinite
Creator—some plan by which he may gain
access to him and become united with him, and
be saved by him from the consequences of his own
sinful acts.</p>

<p>“Fourthly. Such a system must prove its title
to be called a religion by its regenerating effect
on man’s nature; by its influence on his thoughts,
desires, passions, and feelings; by its power in subduing
all his evil tendencies; by its ability to transform
his character and assimilate him to the God
it reveals.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span></p>

<p>This writer claims what all must admit, that
early Buddhism failed in all these requisites, and
was not a religion. It refused to admit a personal
Creator, or man’s dependence on a higher power.
“It denied any external Ego in man. It acknowledged
no external revelation. It had no priesthood—no
real clergy; no real prayer; no real
worship. It had no true idea of sin, or of the need
of pardon, and it condemned man to suffer the consequences
of his own sinful acts without the hope
of help from any Savior or Redeemer, and indeed
from any being but himself.”</p>

<p>A few years ago a former bishop of Calcutta
saw a Buddhist in a temple, and asked him, “What
have you been praying for?” “I have been praying
for nothing.” “To whom have you been praying?”
He answered, “I have been praying to nobody.”
“What, praying for nothing to nobody?” said the
astonished bishop. This is a fair sample of the
religious expression of Buddhists.</p>

<p>This eminent writer admits that later Buddhism
has developed a great reverence for Buddha, the
law, and the monkhood, which is some expression
of man’s sense of need. But in reality this is a
cry from the hungry heart of man for God, which
Buddhism does not recognize nor foster. Pure
Buddhism is atheistic. This author also considers
what claim Gautama has to the title, “The Light
of Asia.” He first points out that “his doctrines
spread only over Eastern Asia, and Confucius, or
Zoroaster, or Mohammed, might equally be called
‘The Light of Asia.’” He also maintains that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
Gautama was not a true light in any sense; that
he claimed little higher than intellectual enlightenment
resulting from intense concentration of all
man’s intellectual powers in introspection. He did
not claim to have any voice regarding the origin
of evil, nor concerning a personal God. His
“light,” in this respect, was “sheer darkness.” And
so the system he founded is as devoid of “light” as
midnight. “All that he claimed to have discovered
was the origin of suffering and the remedy of suffering.
All the light of knowledge to which he
attained came to this: That suffering arises from
indulging desires, especially the desire for the continuity
of life; that suffering is inseparable from
life; that all life is suffering; and that suffering is
to be gotten rid of by the suppression of desires,
and by the extinction of personal existence.”</p>

<p>Here he makes his first great contrast in the
teachings of Christ and Gautama, and says in part:
“It is noteworthy that both Christianity and Buddhism
agree in asserting that all creation groaneth
and travaileth in pain, in suffering, in tribulation.
But mark the vast, the vital distinction in the teaching
of each. The one taught men to be patient
under affliction, and to aim at the utter annihilation
of the suffering body.” Further: “But, say the admirers
of Buddhism, at least you admit that the
Buddha taught men to avoid sin, and to aim at
purity and holiness of life! Nothing of the kind.
The Buddha had no idea of sin as an offense
against God; no idea of true holiness. What he
said was, Get rid of the demerit of evil actions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
and accumulate a stock of merit by good actions.
And let me remark here, that the determination to
store up merit, like capital at a bank, is one of
those inveterate propensities of human nature,
one of those deep-seated tendencies in humanity
which nothing but the divine force imparted by
Christianity can ever eradicate. It is forever cropping
up in the heart of man, as much in the West
as in the East, as much in the North as in the
South; forever reasserting itself like a pestilential
weed, or like tares amidst wheat, forever blighting
the fruit of those good instincts which underlie
man’s nature everywhere.”</p>

<p>He shows the contrast of Gautama and Christ;
the former claiming to be self-sent, having no
divine commission and no external revelation,
while the latter claimed to be sent from God; to
be the Son of God, whose every word has divine
authority; that the gospel is to be proclaimed to
every man in all generations, and that Christ himself
was the Way, the Truth, and the Life. He proceeds
to contrast the Christian Bible with the Buddhist:
“The characteristics of the Christian’s Bible
are that it claims to be a supernatural revelation,
yet it attaches no mystic, talismanic virtue to the
mere sound of words. On the other hand, Buddhism
utterly repudiates all claim to be a supernatural
revelation; yet the very sound of its words is
believed to possess a meritorious efficacy capable of
elevating any one who hears it to heavenly abodes
in future existences. In illustration, I may advert
to a legend current in Ceylon, that once on a time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
five hundred bats lived in a cave where two monks
daily recited the Buddha’s law. These bats gained
such merit by simply hearing the sound of the
words, that when they died they were all reborn
as men, and ultimately as gods.”</p>

<p>We are given another contrast in the kinds of
self-sacrifice taught by the two systems. “But
again I hear the admirers of Buddhism say: Is
it not the case that the doctrine, like the doctrine
of Christ, has self-sacrifice as its keynote? Well,
be it so. I admit that he related of himself that,
on a particular occasion in one of his previous
births, he plucked out his own eyes, and that on
another he cut off his own head as a sacrifice for
the good of others; and that again, on a third
occasion, he cut his own body to pieces to redeem
a dove from a hawk. Yet note the vast difference
of the sacrifice taught by the two systems. Christianity
demands the suppression of selfishness;
Buddhism demands the suppression of self, with
the one object of extinguishing all consciousness
of self. In the one the true self is elevated and
intensified. In the other the true self is annihilated
by a false form of non-selfishness, which has
for its real object not the good of others, but the
annihilation of the Ego, the utter extinction of
the illusion of personal individuality.”</p>

<p>The doctrines which Christ and Gautama bequeathed
to their followers present an equally great
contrast. From the vast difference between them
it is comparatively easy to believe the statement
from Christ that he brought a divine revelation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
and from Gautama that he was self-sent and had
no revelation to make to his followers. The contrast
between the two systems has been arranged
by the same author.</p>

<p>“According to Christianity: Fight, and overcome
the world. According to Buddhism: Shun
the world, and overcome it.</p>

<p>“According to Christianity: Expect a new
earth when the present earth is destroyed; a world
renewed and perfected; a purified world in which
righteousness is to dwell forever. According to
Buddhism: Expect a never-ending succession of
evil worlds coming into existence, developing, decaying,
perishing, and reviving, and all equally full
of everlasting misery, disappointment, illusion,
change, and transmutations.</p>

<p>“According to Christianity, bodily existence is
subject to only one transformation. According to
Buddhism, bodily existence is continued in six
conditions, through countless bodies of men, animals,
demons, ghosts, and dwellers in various hells
and heavens; and that, too, without any progressive
development, but in a constant jumble of metamorphoses
and transmutations.</p>

<p>“Christianity teaches that life in heaven can
never be followed by a fall to a lower state. Buddhism
teaches that life in a higher heaven may be
succeeded by a life in a lower heaven, or even by
a life on earth or in one of the hells.</p>

<p>“According to Christianity, the body of a man
may be the abode of the Spirit of God. According
to Buddhism, the body, whether of men or higher<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
beings, can never be the abode of anything but
evil.</p>

<p>“According to Christianity: Present your
bodies as living sacrifices, holy, acceptable to God,
and expect a change to a glorified body hereafter.
According to Buddhism: Look to final deliverance
from all bodily life, present and to come, as the
greatest of all blessings, highest of all boons, and
loftiest of all aims.</p>

<p>“According to Christianity, a man’s body can
never be changed into the body of a beast, or bird,
or insect, or loathsome vermin. According to
Buddhism, a man, and even a god, may become an
animal of any kind, and even the most loathsome
vermin may again become a man or a god.</p>

<p>“According to Christianity: Stray not from
God’s ways; offend not against his holy laws. According
to Buddhism: Stray not from the eight-fold
path of the perfect man, and offend not against
yourself and the perfect man.</p>

<p>“According to Christianity: Work the works
of God while it is day. According to Buddhism:
Beware of action, as causing rebirth, and aim at
inaction, indifference, and apathy.</p>

<p>“According to the Christian Bible: Regulate
and sanctify the heart, desires, and affections. According
to the Buddhist: Suppress and destroy
them utterly, if you wish for true sanctification.</p>

<p>“Christianity teaches that in the highest form
of life, love is intensified. Buddhism teaches that
in the highest state of existence, all love is extinguished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span></p>

<p>“According to Christianity: Go and earn your
own bread and support your family. Marriage, it
says, is honorable and the bed undefiled, and married
life is a field on which holiness may grow and
develop. Nay, more: Christ himself honored a
wedding with his presence, and took up little children
in his arms and blessed them. Buddhism, on
the other hand, says: Avoid married life; shun it
as if it were a burning of live coals; or, having
entered on it, abandon wife, children, and home,
and go about as celibate monks, engaging in nothing
but in meditation and recitation of the Buddha’s
Law—that is to say, if you aim at the highest
degree of sanctification.”</p>

<p>Then comes greatest of all distinctions, which
separates Christianity and Buddhism.</p>

<p>“Christianity regards personal life as the most
sacred of all possessions. Life, it seems to say,
is no dream, no illusion. ‘Life is real. Life is
earnest.’ Life is the most precious of all God’s
gifts. Nay, it affirms of God himself that he is the
highest example of intense life, of intense personality,
the great ‘I Am That I Am,’ and teaches us
that we are to thirst for a continuance of personal
life as a gift from him, nay, more, that we are to
thirst for the living God himself and for conformity
to his likeness; while Buddhism sets forth as the
highest of all aims the utter extinction of the illusion
of personal identity—the utter annihilation of
the Ego—of all existence in any form whatever,
and proclaims as the true creed the ultimate resolution
of everything into nothing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span></p>

<p>“What shall I do to inherit eternal life?” says
the Christian. “What shall I do to inherit the
eternal extinction of life?” says the Buddhist.</p>

<p>Surely in this comprehensive list of contrasts
the great scholar has shown that there is an immeasurable
height of moral and spiritual philosophy,
and revealed truth concerning God and man
in the Christian religion that Buddhism never conceived.
It has no excellence in moral precept that
is not better stated by Christianity. Christianity
sheds a broad, clear light on the way to find salvation
from sin. Buddhism has no light, and no consolation.
The human heart finds rest in the one,
but the other can not bring a moment’s peace to
any anxious or agonizing soul. Buddhism is a
pessimistic, dark, and desolate system of philosophy,
mistaken for religion.</p>

<span class="subhead">Ripened Fruit of Non-Christian Faiths</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">In</span> setting before the reader the following account
of painful scenes, most of which I have
witnessed, in connection with religious rites, I am
aware that some may say that these facts, though
admitted to have taken place, are not characteristic
of the religion in which they are found. Having
given much attention to this pertinent question,
I am convinced that they are some of the legitimate
fruit of religious systems without Christ.
This book is not written to theorize about religion,
so much as to give an account of what a missionary
sees living in Burma in direct contact with its
varied people.</p>

<p>The theoretical teaching of Buddhism, Mohammedanism,
or Hinduism may be one thing,
while the practical religious usages may bear quite
another character. A people may naturally be very
agreeable and have many lovable traits, and yet
their religious rites may degrade and not uplift
the natural man. The saddest part of the following
account is found in its degradation of the ordinary
healthful sentiments of the people, in the name
of religion.</p>

<p>Then, again, what is done openly in the name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
of any religion, is done that it may be seen and
recognized as of that religion. Therefore, it is
certainly characteristic. If the observance of this
is repeated, or is related to that which is of frequent
occurrence, it is certainly characteristic.
That which is here recorded is the natural fruitage
of the religions which cheat the natural hunger
of the human heart for the favor of God, whom all
have sinned against, but whose loving mercy is
not known among these Christless millions.</p>

<p>Before giving an account of the cruelties still
observed by devotees and fanatics, it is well to
remember some terrible practices which have been
abolished in recent years. These include suttee, or
widow-burning, hook-swinging, the Juggernaut,
and marriage of little girls. These were all religious
practices, but they were abolished by the Government.
Theoretically and practically, the English
Government in India is neutral in religion. Only
a Christian Government could be strictly neutral
in religious matters, though other Governments
at times have been tolerant of other faiths to some
extent. By proclamation, the English rule in India
is neutral in religion. This proclamation is adhered
to literally, so that a Mohammedan, Hindu, or
Buddhist has just as much protection under the law
as a Christian, and neither has any powers above
the other.</p>

<p>How, then, does it come to pass that the Government
has interfered in religious rites? This
was done only when such rites actually took life,
or endangered life. The Government’s first duty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
is to protect the lives of its subjects, even against
self-destruction, where that is possible. Many
questionable deeds are yet done by devotees in
which the Government has not interfered, though
some of them are exceedingly cruel, because they
have not actually endangered life.</p>

<p>But suttee, or widow-burning, has been prohibited
by the Government, though still practiced
among the Hindus beyond the English border.
Bishop Thoburn gives an account of the burning
of four widows in Nepal, a little more than a quarter
of a century ago. The dead husband had been
high in the service of the Indian Government, and
had been honored with a title by Queen Victoria.
He was a Hindu, and he died over the border in
Nepal, and four of his widows were burned with his
body. This shows the spirit of Hinduism where it
is not restrained by a Christian law. You can not
burn people on any pretext under the British flag.</p>

<p>Hook-swinging was another horrible practice,
which was put down in the same way. Devotees
were placed on hooks suspended on long ropes
fastened high above, and the hooks fastened deep
in the flesh of the devotees. The body was then
swung from side to side till its momentum tore the
hooks from the flesh, and the torn and bleeding
body fell to the ground, perhaps to die, certainly
to be permanently maimed. The law suppressed
this practice, and it is no longer perpetuated except
in remote regions and under great secrecy.</p>

<p>The car Juggernaut, with its great idol, when
drawn along the roads at the Juggernaut festival<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
evoked such fanaticism that men threw themselves
under its great wheels, and were crushed. This
practice has been prohibited by law. The festival
is still observed, but men do not throw themselves
under the wheels. I have seen the great car, with
its hideous idol, drawn past our mission-house in
Rangoon, attended by thousands of Hindus, with
all the noise and confusion of an Oriental procession;
but there is no blood on its wheels now, and
no crushed bodies are left in the street.</p>

<p>There was another even more terrible custom
prevalent in India for ages, in which the Government
had to interfere. It has for centuries been
the custom of Hindus to give their little girls in
marriage when tender children. They were married
at ten or eleven years of age, or even at nine
years. To appreciate this monstrous cruelty it
should be remembered that a child of the same age
in Western lands is much stronger than a child
in India. There were many mothers in India at
twelve years of age. The cruelties of this practice
of child marriage were such that they can not be
written. Let it be remembered that this practice
existed for hundreds of years, and that practically
all the Hindus approved it, although the sufferers
were their own children. And when the terribleness
of the practice was so pressed on the Government
that it could not avoid taking action, and
consequently framed a bill to raise the age of consent
to twelve years, before which it would be unlawful
to consummate marriage, the whole Hindu
world rose up in protest. They charged the bill to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
the oppression of the Government. Fifty thousand
Hindus met in public protest in the city of Calcutta.
This protest was from Hindus directed against a
righteous law for the protection of their children
from this age-old cruelty!</p>

<p>To the writer it has been an experience of a
painful kind to find a few Americans crying out
against the “Oppression of England in India,”
when they are only echoing the cry of the Hindus
against the righteous law. But the law was enacted,
and has had a wholesome effect so far as
it is not evaded by false statements of the age of
the girls, which are often made.</p>

<p>But if England had no other justification for
her Government in India than these four enactments,
the Government would have much to its
credit. But these are legal protections thrown
around her people to prevent them taking life, or
perpetuating cruelty in the name of religion. If
monstrous things are still done, it is a comfort to
know that these named have been abolished.</p>

<p>Once each year a sect of Mohammedans torture
themselves by running through the fire. This torture
occurs during the feast which follows the
Mohammedan fast, or lent. During this fast the
Mohammedan community eat nothing from sunrise
to sunset. They may eat a great deal after
sunset and before sunrise. Having fasted in this
manner for forty days, they feast for three days.
But this does not include all of the community.
There is a division of the Mohammedans dating
back to the death of Mohammed. A quarrel then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
arose over his successor as leader of the Mohammedans.
One party held to Hassan and Hoosan,
the sons of the prophet; and the opposing party
stood for another leader. This division led to
war, in which Hassan and Hoosan were slain
and their party defeated. This contention has been
maintained until the present, and those of the conquering
party are known as <em>Sunni</em> Mohammedans,
and the followers of Hoosan and Hassan are called
<em>Shia</em> Mohammedans. The latter will not feast with
the other party, and take this occasion to torture
themselves by running through the fire, as a protest
against the opposing sect.</p>

<p>The preparations for this torture by fire are
made deliberately, and it is carried out on a large
scale. First of all, they must secure the permission
of the Rangoon magistrate to this ordeal. Then
they publish the places where it will occur, for it
is celebrated in several localities on the same night.
Ditches are dug deep enough to hold a great mass
of coals, and two or more rods in length. On the
day appointed, a large supply of dry wood being
provided, a fire is kindled in the ditches about noon,
and is kept burning until long after dark. Meantime
the ditch has been filled with coals smoldering,
and kept alive, but not allowed to burn to ashes.
As the earlier hours of the night have been passing,
multitudes of all nationalities have gathered
at the scene of fire-running. They have to be kept
at a distance by a cordon of rope stretched about
a considerable circle. As midnight passes, a spirit
of expectancy takes possession of the waiting multitude,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
which is increased by shouts and excitement
in a side street not far away. These are all according
to the Oriental’s idea of working up a climax
of interest in his spectacular display. A little after
midnight the fanatics who have been selected to
undergo this torture come rushing from a side
street, carrying banners and shouting in increasing
excitement as they enter the arena and approach
the fire on the run. Crowding close together at
the end of the ditch of fire, they wave their banners,
chant, shout, and shriek until a frenzy possesses
them, and then they plunge into the fire
with their bared feet and legs! The first man to
leap into the fire sinks more than half way to his
knees in the fiery pit, and the next step also, and so
through the ditch. As might be supposed, he
plunges through as fast as possible with his greatest
strides. He is followed in turn by every other of
the twenty or more fanatics of his company.</p>

<p>They immediately collect at the other end of
the ditch, and with even greater frenzy than before
scream, stamp the coals from feet, and plunge
again through the ditch. So from end to end they
rush till the coals are dragged out of the ditch
clinging to their feet and legs, or are kicked out
on the surrounding ground. Then the fanatics disappear,
and the multitude of curious onlookers
disperse.</p>

<p>This cruel practice is carried out every year
among these Mohammedan immigrants to the
province of Burma. The idea seems to be a frenzied
appeal to God that their contention, settled by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
the sword in the defeat of their party twelve centuries
ago, was right. This particular revolting
exhibition may be a modern development; but if
so, it is but another evidence of the growth of
fanatical extravagance of an imperfect faith. But
viewed in any light, it is a sad commentary on the
Christless Mohammedan world in this twentieth
century of the Christian era. It is a fact to be
lamented that Christian missions are not generally
directed to the adherents of the Mohammedan
faith.</p>

<p>Lest it be thought that such fanaticism is only
representative of the lower class of people, let this
circumstance be noted. On one occasion my wife
saw this “fire-running.” Just before the expected
approach of the company designated to run
through the fire, a finely-dressed Mohammedan
merchant came within the ropes, with the air of a
man who intended to act as a self-appointed master
of ceremonies over these fanatics, lest they act too
outrageously. But when the excitement of the
occasion was on, and these common people were
rushing through the fire, he began to show every
indication of rising excitement. He sat down, rose
up, sat down again. He took off one shoe, jumped
up, and sat down again; then off came both stockings,
and he plunged into the fire like any other
of these frenzied people. This shows the terrible
power of such enormities over even the self-poised
Mohammedan merchant.</p>

<p>Another scene we witnessed among the Hindus,
even more revolting than this annual exhibition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
among the Mohammedans. It was on a Sabbath-day,
and Bishop Thoburn was with us on his biennial
visit to Burma. The early morning service
at the English Church had been concluded, and we
were going to the mission-house in the cantonments.
The day was growing almost intolerably
hot, especially under the direct rays of the sun, as
it was in the latter part of April, the hottest time
of the year. As we rode along under the protection
of our covered tum-tum, we saw just ahead
of us in the middle of the Signal Pagoda Road,
the main street between the city and the suburbs,
an excited company of Hindu pilgrims and their
attendants. It is a striking fact, too, that the
scene we beheld was very near a Christian church
located on that road—a Christian church dedicated
to the worship of Him who died for all men—and
here by the side of that edifice on that Lord’s-day,
nearly twenty centuries after the gospel was
proclaimed to a sin-darkened world, was enacted
one of the most distressing cruelties of heathenism,
and it is doubtful if the devotees, or their attendants,
even dreamed of the salvation which every
Christian temple should suggest! That Church
does nothing for missions, being content to preach
only to those who bear the Christian name.</p>

<p>There was a company of about twenty men,
eight of whom were devotees, while the others
urged them on their terrible way. Around each
devotee’s neck was an iron ring supporting twenty-four
small chains about two feet in length. On
the end of each chain was a large hook made of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
wire, and these two dozen hooks were buried deep
in the chest, sides, and back of each poor man.
The flesh was raised in great welts over the buried
hooks! But to add to the horrors of this torture,
each man had an iron rod about the size of a slate-pencil
thrust through both cheeks, passing through
the mouth, of course. Another rod of equal size
pierced the tongue, which was drawn out of the
mouth as far as could be done without plucking
it from its roots, the rod holding it in that drawn
condition, as it was held against the face by the
strained muscles. These hooks and iron rods piercing
the flesh of body and face must have produced
all the agony that the human frame could endure.
Yet the cruelties of the heathen could add to even
this. Most of the poorer natives of India go barefooted.
But these devotees wore wooden sandals,
not to protect the feet, but to torture them.
Through these sandals from below nails were
driven and sharpened above, so that every step
each poor man took the weight of his body pressed
upon the upturned nails, and must have produced
a refinement of agony. To the natural weight of
the body was added a wooden arch often used
among this class of Hindus in Rangoon as a symbol,
this arch being carried on the shoulder and
adding possibly twenty pounds to press down his
tortured body upon those upturned nails! These
poor deluded sons of our unhappy race, these devotees
of a Christless faith, were agonizing along this
highway under a pitiless tropical sun, making their
way to a Hindu shrine eight miles away! Their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
condition was indescribable. Their attendants
were urging them forward with shouts, and were
dashing water on their protruding tongues, seemingly
untouched with pity at their agony.</p>

<p>The very sight of this torture made the heart
sick. I doubt if any Christian man could have endured
the sight for any length of time. An indescribable
faintness began to sweep over me; and
the bishop, who has a heart of great tenderness,
could hardly speak; but as he turned to me I noted
an expression of anguish on his face, as he said
in broken tones: “That is the worst sight I have
witnessed in thirty-five years in India; but that is
the <em>ripened fruit of idolatry</em>.”</p>

<p>Let the reader again recall that this occurred
in the closing years of the nineteenth century of
our gospel era. Let him also be informed that
among all these thousands of Hindu immigrants to
India there is not one missionary giving his time
to preaching Christ. The only reason there is not
such a missionary is because there is no money
in any mission treasury to send him. There is
plenty of money in Christian hands. If the Christian
men and women of those lands that are the
heirs of all temporal blessings, and of the Christian
joys of the gospel centuries, could realize the blackness
of the night that has settled down on the
Christless nations, who are heirs of thousands of
years of increasing idolatry, they would hasten
the messengers of life and light to these poor
people.</p>

<p>If we turn to Buddhism and ask for correspondingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
desperate conditions, we are at once assured
that they are not found. Its friends would assure
us of its elevated character as a religion. But I
am sure we find a sad enough condition among
some of the most faithful Buddhists, and a refinement
of cruelty in all classes of the adherents of
the teachings of Gautama. The building of a pagoda
is regarded as the most meritorious deed,
and even its repair or partial regilding gives a man
honor and merit. But the serving of a pagoda
renders a man an outcast. The only real outcast
ever recognized in Burmese Buddhism, which
is free from the Indian caste system, is the “pagoda
slave.” Perhaps we ought to speak of this in the
past tense, as the English rule has made it possible
for these slaves to find their freedom, which was
impossible under Burmese rule, though even this
legal liberty is not recognized by the Buddhists.</p>

<p>Under Buddhist, or Burmese, order, whole families
were set apart for the pagoda service. Once
in that service they were despised by their self-respecting
co-religionists, and their children after
them forever suffered their disabilities. Sometimes
a certain number of families in a village were
arbitrarily picked up and set down at the pagoda
for this purpose, henceforth to be banished from
the circle of respectability. Never could any man
get out of this degraded service. The heaviest
penalties were laid upon any who tried to aid him
or his family to escape to any other calling.</p>

<p>Why this strange degradation of men and
women who serve the pagoda, when the building of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
a pagoda exalts its builder here and hereafter, does
not seem to be explained. Personally, I think it
one of the stony-hearted cruelties natural to this
faith. The priests were fed daily out of the household’s
store; but the pagoda caretaker had to fight
with the ownerless dogs, with which Burma
abounds, for some of the food offered to the images
of Gautama! When the slave died he could not
have respectable burial. Sometimes his body was
thrown out with the refuse for the dogs to eat.
This settled policy of Buddhism may be truly said
to be one of its perfected fruits, not mentioned by
the friends of the faith from Western lands.</p>

<p>Under British rule these people were allowed
to become sellers of supplies for the pagoda service,
or to go away where, unknown and carefully
disguising their former life, they might work into
some respectable occupation, but never with the
consent of Buddhist priests or self-respecting laymen,
who had always despised the servant of the
temple. But the sight which always met the observers
when visiting the great Sway Dagon Pagoda
in Rangoon until recent years, was the line
of lepers always piteously begging along its ascending
steps. They were classed with the pagoda
slave, and were despised. It can not be said that
they were really pitied, even though some corn or
rice and an occasional copper coin were thrown
them by the Buddhist climbing the stair to Gautama’s
shrine. These lepers were born on these
steps, diseased, rotted, and died there! A more
pitiable sight was never witnessed than these poor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
suffering creatures, practically expelled outside the
bounds of Buddhist sympathy for no fault of character
or conduct. Of course, the Buddhist would
say that the leper’s foul disease was the <em>demerit</em>
of some past existence, and therefore he suffers
justly in his loathsome condition, and his ostracism
from human sympathy! But this is only another
heartless invention of a much overrated
religion.</p>

<p>The reader will have made the contrast. Centuries
of labor and millions in gifts to raise and
perfect the great pagoda and to gild it and to bejewel
its tinkling bells, all in honor of eight human
hairs; while its own faithful adherents suffer and
die without so much as a shed being built to shelter
them! Millions for gilding brick and mortar, and
not the least coin to build a hospital for suffering
and despairing men! This is Buddhism’s fruitage
of the centuries. Let him praise the tender sympathies
of this faith who will. To me it is one of
the most heartless systems taught among men.
The leper was an outcast here, and taught to believe
millions of years of existence in hell were
awaiting him hereafter. This was his portion in
Buddhism.</p>

<p>Turn now and witness what Christianity has
done for him. Within the decade of my writing,
the Christian missions of Burma became strong
enough to put their sympathies underneath the
long suffering lepers. A Scotch leper mission is
aiding the Wesleyans at Mandalay. Later the Baptists
in Moulmein, and the Catholics on their own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
account in Rangoon, built leper asylums, the Government
aiding also in their support; and the lepers
in every municipality in Burma have been gathered
into these Christian institutions, their sores bound
up, medicines to alleviate their sufferings given,
abundant food and suitable clothing provided, the
first time to most of them during their agonized
lives. Best of all, the gospel, with its help, love,
and hope, is preached to them who had been bound
to suffering for ages to come by their own religious
system! If to the question, “Do missions to the
Burmese Buddhists pay?” there could be offered
only these three leper asylums, they would warrant
the answer, “Yes.”</p>

<p>One very hot afternoon I went with an assistant
of the Wesleyan Leper Asylum, and took
twenty-five of those lepers off the steps of the
Sway Dagon Pagoda, and securing their passage
money from the Rangoon municipality, I sent them
off to Mandalay. Later I visited that city and the
asylum, and there beheld one hundred and forty
of the lepers gathered from many places in Burma.
They were so well cared for as to seem almost content
in spite of their physical suffering. They were
fed, clothed, and had the gospel preached to them
in the true Christian spirit. Some of them were
filled with peace and joy by conscious communion
with Him who is so mightily preached by this
institution of mercy. There was one leper, with
hands and feet fallen off, an eye gone, and the
tongue nearly eaten away; still on the piece of a
face that remained there shone a light seen only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
on the face of the man who communes with God.
In this glad vision I had my reward in having
aided in a small way to send so many afflicted ones
to this Christian haven. A thousand times since
I have been made glad with the memory of what
seemed that hot afternoon a very commonplace
piece of work. But as it retreats into the past, and
I know every poor sufferer will have had Christian
care all his days, it came to be recognized as one of
my greatest privileges as a missionary to have had
some part in this work.</p>

<p>When in the future the traveler comes to Burma
and visits the pagoda, and when the resident passes
through Rangoon’s streets, and is not pained with
the vision of lepers begging at his feet, let them
remember that for centuries these Buddhist lepers
were spurned by their own race and countrymen,
and that it was the Christian missionaries who
gathered them into homelike asylums, there to receive
loving Christian care. Let them reflect that
this contrast is one of principle in the two faiths.
The leper, agonizing in hopeless despair on the
pagoda steps, was the perfected fruit of centuries
of the teaching of the purest Buddhism to be found.</p>

<p>One more illustration of the practical teaching
of Buddhism presents itself. At Kemmendine,
near Rangoon, is a Buddhist burial-ground. There
is a large pavilion near the entrance to the graveyard,
on the ceiling of which there have been various
pictorial representations of the teachings of
Buddhism. Much of this is a portrayal of the
many Buddhist hells. But there was for years a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
succession of pictures along one border representing
the Buddhist priest in the process of crushing
out all sentiment and sympathy with even the
greatest human distress. The candidate for <i>neikban</i>
must destroy all desire; the last desire to give
way is that for existence. This pictorial representation
was evidently made to show the process of
this suppression in progress. The yellow-robed
priest, who should represent the system, is seated
in perfect composure looking on the distress of a
sick man. There is none to attend the sick, and
the priest, of course, gives no aid. The next picture
shows the man approaching the crisis of death; in
the next he is actually dying. Then follows a succession
of pictures showing other stages of dissolution,
until only the scattered bones remain.
Through all the series of representations the priest
sits with a face as expressionless as marble, and
has not moved a muscle. Complete indifference
to all experiences of human life is the virtue
aimed at.</p>

<p>To show that this crushing out of all natural
sensibility is a difficult process, the artist has made
another picture with a little humor in it. The scattered
bones suddenly become articulated, and the
skeleton makes a wild leap upon the priest. This
unexpected jump of the skeleton would be calculated
to affright ordinary mortals to a degree; but
not so the priest. He only slightly turns his head.
<em>He has nearly conquered all natural sentiment.</em> The
last picture shows a skull and crossbone, and the
motionless priest sitting in perfect composure of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
features and of person. He has conquered all
desire!</p>

<p>This is the picture on the pavilion; but now
with the writer look on the living reality. On one
occasion I attended a cremation in that burial-ground.
Sometimes bodies are buried, and sometimes
cremated if the person was rich or much
respected in life. The funeral pyre was crudely
made, and the burning presented a revolting sight
that need not be given in detail. When the body
was nearly consumed some of the people returned
to the pavilion, and with them the widow, a grown
son and daughter, and some smaller children of the
deceased. Meantime five priests had come in from
the monastery, and sat in a row upon a platform at
one end of the structure. They had not been present
at the place of burning. They had rendered
no service of consolation at all, though they may
have preached at the home the usual pronouncement
of Buddhism, that all existence leads to
misery, and therefore the way out of misery is to
strive to get into neikban and cease to exist. More
than this, the funeral is the occasion over all others
in which costly presents far above the ability of
the family are given to the <i>poungyis</i>, or priests.
But real consoling service to the sorrowing they
give none. There is nothing springing from sympathy,
pity, or hope in this religion.</p>

<p>As these five well-fed priests sat on that platform,
the broken-hearted widow, son, and daughters
came forward, and bowed down and worshiped
them. The bruised and broken human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
heart cried in anguish and must cry for help, and
Buddhism offers only the worship of a yellow-robed
priest! Buddhism has no God. It tries to
crush all human pity. But where shall the broken-hearted
find rest? Worship these yellow-robed
priests! That is all. What about the priests?
There they sat, and chewed betel-nut and tobacco,
spitting lazily at the cracks in the platform, looking
about idly and vacantly, utterly indifferent to the
prostrate and broken-hearted family before them!
Not a look of sympathy or pity, not even a glance
of recognition cast in the direction of the prostrate
forms! This is the very real illustration in the
living priest, of the pictorial representation of the
priest of the Buddhist religion given above! The
Buddhist system is devoid of hope, pity, consolation,
or even ordinary human sympathy. It is as
heartless as its own stony or brazen images of
Gautama so universally worshiped. Men become
like their gods.</p>

<span class="subhead">Outline of Christian Missions in Burma</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Christianity</span> entered Burma with the incoming
of traders and Governments from
the West, as it did in the other portions of Southern
Asia. Some of these traders and some of
these representatives of nominally Christian Governments
were unscrupulous adventurers. They
were seldom men of strict moral integrity, much
less spiritual Christians. They would not measure
very high by present-day social standards,
much less by the lofty standards of the gospel.
They were Christians in name only. The Portuguese
gained some footing in Burma, as in all
this tropical world, in the sixteenth century, and
continued with varying influence for nearly two
hundred years. They gained a foothold in Burma,
and built a city called Syrian, and still bearing
that name, just across the Pegu River from the
present site of Rangoon. Here, however, they
met utter defeat and destruction at the hands of
the great Alombra, the founder of the Burmese
Dynasty, of which King Thebaw, deposed at
Mandalay in 1886, was the last sovereign. This
great king completely overthrew the Portuguese
Government, and with it the only form of Christianity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
then known among them, that represented
by the Roman Catholic Church of that day.</p>

<p>These venturesome Portuguese carried with
them their religious observances, and their priests
always were active missionary agents. They built
a church at Syrian, the well-defined ruins of which
still remain. They made converts among the
Burmans. Whether their methods in converting
the Burmese were as unscrupulous as the
Portuguese traders’ methods were, we have no
detailed account. But in this matter we are not
left in much doubt, as their attempts to convert
the Burmese could not have been much different
from that employed in India at the same period,
which unhappily we know only too well were in
utter disregard of the true Christian spirit. But
these missionaries of the Catholic Church counted
their converts by possibly the hundred thousand.</p>

<p>These foreigners on their shores were then,
as all are now, regarded as representatives of the
Christian religion. In Asia every man is regarded
as an adherent of some religion. Little account
is taken of whether he represents his faith or misrepresents
it. His Government and his personal
and social life are supposed to flow from his religion;
so that the Christian religion, as represented
by the Portuguese, was probably despised
as cordially by the Buddhists as their commercial
prestige and Government authority were hated by
the Burmese people. And when they made war
to the extermination of the Portuguese settlements
and their fortified city, and sunk their ships<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
in the river, they also dealt a fatal blow to Catholic
missions in Burma. There remains little trace
of their old-time teaching. This is very unfortunate;
for it is only just to say that even the Catholicism
of two centuries ago taught more truth
concerning God and God’s dealings with men
than Buddhism ever did in its best state. Nominal
Christianity, even when half idolatrous, kept the
name of God alive in the minds of men, while
they waited for a better day in which the gospel
would be preached in its purity.</p>

<p>With the beginning of the nineteenth century
the British began to get control of Burma, and
this advantage has been followed by further acquisitions
of territory until in 1886 Upper Burma
was annexed, and so the whole land has come
under the English flag. During this century, with
its better Governmental conditions, the Catholic
Church has re-established its institutions in all
parts of the province. For many years its growth
was slow, and even now, in numbers, it is far exceeded
by the Baptist mission. But in the last ten
years there has been a marked growth in the
Catholic community. This has been to some extent
by immigrants from India, who are Catholics.
But the Church has been aggressive in
every respect. Its priests are multiplying in the
cities, and they also have occupied strategic points
in the interiors. They are especially far-seeing
in the acquisition of great properties in cities like
Rangoon and in building schools and charitable
institutions. They are now engaged in building<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
a great cathedral, to add to their already enormous
properties in the capital city, and, as usual,
have chosen a most conspicuous location, near
the great Government offices.</p>

<p>Of course, in Burma, as elsewhere, they need
the Protestant Churches, though they will not admit
it. They regard us all as heretics. But they
have been improved by Protestant missions, and
need a great deal more of the same influence.
While they give Protestants no recognition, save
in an external civility, they are indebted to Protestant
activity for the revival of that which is best
in their own methods of work, especially in education;
and we will still have to teach a pure,
spiritual, experimental religion as a protest against
their mechanical ritualism and exclusive pretension,
and, most of all, against their semi-idolatrous
practices. A concrete example of this is found in
the usages that make the Catholic cemetery on
“All Souls’ Day” look like the adorning of a
Buddhist feast; that make them still celebrate
mass annually with great pomp for the repose of
the soul of their late bishop, a noble man, whom
we Protestants would gladly believe to have been
accepted of God in Christ Jesus, and not needing
the unbiblical fiction of purgatory to purify his
soul and fit it to dwell with God.</p>

<p>But the greatest missionary labors wrought in
Burma have been wrought by the American Baptists.
From Adoniram Judson, who landed in
Burma in 1813, until the present generation of
missionaries, there has been an increasing force<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
of faithful and heroic men and women who have
devoted their lives to the redemption of Burma.
It is safe to say that the sum of the work of all
missionaries of all other societies combined would
not equal that done by the Baptists. It is also
true that the number of their converts from among
the people of Burma equal, or exceed, the sum
of all others. The mere outline of their extensive
mission, with a history of eighty-eight years behind
it, can not be given in the space allowed in
the plan of this book. It is the writer’s joy, however,
to make the fullest recognition of their great
work that space will allow, and also in justice to
others and the field, to point out some of their
limitations as a mission.</p>

<p>It is well known that the quality of their spiritual
work is of the best. They are faithful teachers
of experimental religion, and they lead blameless
lives. They are, and have been from the beginning,
faithful examples and witnesses for a
sterling morality in a land where lax morals were
too common. They have been advocates of total
abstinence in a land where dram-drinking was,
until recently, almost universal, and is still deeply
intrenched in social usage, as liquor-selling is in
business.</p>

<p>These same missionaries were pioneers in education,
having extensive schools long before the
Government had an educational system. They
had given the Karens, among whom they have
had their greatest successes, a written language,
as well as having led tens of thousands of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
into the Christian Church. The census of Burma
in 1891 says the Karens have been preserved as
a people only by the labors of the missionaries.
These people now have many primary schools, as
well as some of higher grades.</p>

<p>There are two institutions of this higher education
worthy of special mention. One is the
Baptist college of Rangoon, with Rev. J.&nbsp;N. Cushing,
D.&nbsp;D., and a full corps of well-equipped teachers,
and an attendance of more than five hundred
students, including primary grades. In schools
of higher education in the East the lower grades
are always taught also; hence the large total. The
other is their theological school at Eusein, near
Rangoon, with which Rev. D.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;W. Smith, D.&nbsp;D.,
has been connected for nearly forty years. This
school has from one hundred and twenty-five to
one hundred and fifty students preparing for the
ministry. They represent several races, but are
mostly Karens, corresponding with the greater
numbers of these people in the Baptist Churches
in the province. A large amount of the money
for the support of this theological school is paid
by the Karen Churches.</p>

<p>Here may be noted another important feature
of the successful work of the Baptist mission.
They have probably done as much toward teaching
the native Churches self-support as any other
great missions of Southern Asia. They have many
churches and schools practically supported by the
villages in which they are found. It is true that
most of these are in the Karen villages, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
the people live apart from all others and do not
migrate much. It is noteworthy, also, that all
peoples in Burma are in possession of far more
means than in any other portion of the Indian
Empire, and they can give more easily and more
in amount than in Upper India, the Telegu missions.
Yet, after all allowances are made, the
fact still remains, and it is most creditable to the
mission, that they have developed self-support to
an encouraging extent, by which other missions
could profitably be instructed.</p>

<p>This mission has a large publishing-house, and
a great quantity of literature, mostly periodicals
and tracts, is published. It also circulates many
books and pamphlets. The young Church has
need of much of this, especially the Karens. This
same press issues several different styles of Judson’s
translation of the Bible into the Burmese
tongue, and also the Karen, Shan, and Kachin,
translations of the entire Bible, or portions of the
Scriptures.</p>

<p>It is here, however, we meet a serious lack.
The Burmese read more than any other Oriental
people, unless the Japanese be excepted. Yet the
literature adequate to carry on a great campaign
of Christian enlightment of these Buddhists has
never yet been produced. Perhaps this lack is
due to several causes, one of which is that there
are only a comparatively few Burmese Christians.
But still, all missionaries should face this
need, and provide for it.</p>

<p>The translation of the Bible into Burmese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
would alone render the name of Judson immortal.
But it has one serious defect that can not be overlooked
in writing even a sketch of missions in
Burma. He, being an ardent Baptist, has fixed
the extreme Baptist teaching on the mode of baptism
on the translation of the New Testament.
Other bodies justly contend that this is not translating,
but interpreting a modern doctrinal controversy
into the text of the Burmese Bible. The
Baptists declare they can not yield anything of
this position, and all other missions are equally
convinced they can not use a biased text. After
long negotiations seeking ground for a compromise,
but failing, it has been decided to put out
another translation of the New Testament, which
alone, in the Judson translation, bears this particular
defect. This new translation is now in
progress under the direction of the British and
Foreign Bible Society. On this question the great
Baptist mission needs the teaching of other Protestant
bodies on the mission-field as they do in
the home lands.</p>

<p>While noting the extensive work of the Baptist
mission in Burma, and so cordially rejoicing
in their success, it becomes necessary to point out
another limitation of this very successful mission.
This defect is merely a limitation in the
means to an end. Much as has been done, this
great society <em>can not evangelise Burma alone</em>. It
is exceedingly difficult for the people at home to
understand that Burma is a very great country,
and her peoples are diverse to a degree an American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
who has not lived in Southern Asia can not
understand.</p>

<p>The population of Burma numbers more than
8,000,000. Of these the Burmese Buddhists number
more than 6,000,000. From these millions of
Buddhists there are less than 4,000 converts in
all the evangelical missions in Burma. Karens
number less than 500,000, and yet there is a Christian
community of nearly 100,000 among these
people. So far as evangelization is concerned, the
ingathering from the Karens has, to date, been
nearly twenty per cent, while among the Burmans
it has not been one-fifteenth of one per cent. Yet
the Burmese people are the important people of
the land in numbers and influence. They are superior
people to the Karens, and they assert that
superiority. It was hoped that the Burmese
would be evangelized by the Karens, but that
hope has not been realized, and it is not within
practical missionary expectation to look for it
longer. There must be a stupendous and prolonged
missionary campaign made to convert the
Burmese millions. This will require every devoted
man and woman of every society that can be rallied
to this gigantic task. The further fact should
be noted, also, to show its urgency. While the
Karens have been converted by the scores of thousands
and the work of conversion and organization
goes right on, though at a slower pace than
at one time, it is probably true that the Karens
are being Burmanized and converted to Buddhism
faster than they are being converted to Christianity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
Hence our greater missionary campaign
has yet to be planned, and it must be fought out
with Buddhism, and this will require all the available
men and women and all the money all the
societies now at work in Burma can get.</p>

<p>Here we witness a providential ordering. God
has called missionaries into Burma from various
lands and set them to a common task. Each set
of missionaries may easily think they alone are,
or should be, assigned to this field; but God, whose
plans are far greater than man’s narrow vision,
thrusts diverse agencies into the field, and the
writer believes each could have abundant justification
of its presence and hard work in the land.</p>

<p>One of the Churches longest represented in
Burma is the Church of England. It is the policy
of this Church to provide some service for its people
in remote regions. With the early planting of
the British flag in Burma, as elsewhere, came
some representatives of the Established Church.
They were not always very devoted men, but some
of them have been among the godliest servants
of our Lord. They usually have ministered to the
English-speaking people as chaplains of civilians
or of the military. As such they are found in every
locality where Europeans or their descendants
congregate. Had this considerable number
of clergy always been spiritual men, their influence
for good would have been of incalculable
value. Had the majority stood for evangelical
truth, as a few have, had they been teetotalers in
a land of dram-drinking, and had they spoken with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
moral and spiritual authority against the licentiousness
of many, they would have saved the people
and themselves, and won an unfading crown and
the favor of all who love righteousness. Some
have so lived. One such died in Rangoon a few
years ago, one of the most devoted and best loved
ministers I have ever known.</p>

<p>These ministers of the Church of England have
had the ears of the people as none others could
have had, by reason of their social and official
standing. But because they have not always pursued
their calling with single-eyed devotion, others
have been required to help them save the neglected
people.</p>

<p>The Church of England has not been primarily
a missionary Church in Burma, though latterly it
is doing a good deal of work directly for the non-Christian
peoples. Their greatest native work is
among the Karens, who came to them years ago
chiefly by a secession from the Baptist mission.
They have held most of these seceders, but have
not gained rapidly from among the heathen Karens.
It is among a people like this that strict
habits of life tell so much. The Karens as a race
are much given to drunkenness. Most missionaries—all
of the Baptists—are total abstainers and
constant advocates of this most wholesome practice.
But some of the Church of England and
Catholic missionaries are habitual dram-drinkers.
The effect of this practice among the missionaries
is very bad in its effect on the native Church. It
is not a pleasant thing to write of these defects,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
but this drink-habit is so common among Europeans,
and the example of men who assume
the office of missionaries counts for so much for
good or bad with native Christians who have this
vice to fight that the unwillingness of the missionaries
to abstain from strong drink is most reprehensible.
This fact is only a little less important
among ministers to Europeans. I have yet to
see the minister of any class whose influence for
good is not dissipated by taking the intoxicating
cup under any circumstances.</p>

<p>The fact that any considerable number of
clergymen in a mission-field drink intoxicating
liquor will surprise most people in America, where,
if a clergyman tipples, he is at once under a social
ban. But it is a pleasure to write that the reprehensible
practice is growing less in the entire East.
The Churches and ministry which make total abstinence
an unyielding rule would be needed in
this mission-field for their testimony and practice
of total abstinence, if for no other reason. We
dare not gather a native Church and leave them
under the curse of drink. We dare not keep
silent and by our practice encourage the drink-habit
among Europeans and their descendants.
The minister or missionary who has the temerity
to do it takes great responsibility for wrecked
lives of those who follow his practice. It would
seem to be as clear as sunlight that, knowing the
evil of the drink-habit in the East, as they do, all
ministers and missionaries would stand unitedly
and unwaveringly for total abstinence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span></p>

<p>The Catholics, Baptists, and Church of England
have been operating in Burma through the
greater part of the century that has just closed.
But the Methodist Episcopal mission and the
Wesleyans came upon the scene much later. Of
the Methodist Episcopal missions I have written
elsewhere. It is only necessary to indicate here
that, in the language of Bishop Thoburn, “our
work in Burma was thrust upon us rather than
sought by us.” It was taken up as a far-away
outpost of our beginnings in Calcutta. It has
since become one of the important smaller missions
established in all strategic centers from Karachi
to the Philippine Islands. Our organization
in Rangoon dates from 1879. We have only fairly
gotten our footing, and hope soon to move forward
with a good degree of momentum. A detailed
account of the mission is found in following
chapters.</p>

<p>The Wesleyans began their work in Burma in
1886, just after the annexation of Upper Burma.
They made the great city of Mandalay their chief
center of labor, and they have occupied important
towns on the Irrawaddy River, the Chindwin, and
on the railway. Their location was wisely selected,
and their advance has been made with equal good
judgment.</p>

<p>They wisely selected the Burmese people as
their objective from the first, and excepting their
first superintendent, they have made the mastering
of the language the first duty of every new
missionary. In this they have been exceedingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
clearsighted. While the mission has not been
large in numbers, it has maintained a good working
force, and had latterly sent forward re-enforcements.
They maintain nine or ten missionaries,
men and women, who are in the full vigor of their
earlier manhood and womanhood, and they are
steadily gathering a native Church. Meantime,
they have added English work and taken up the
lepers, mentioned elsewhere, as a specialty. They
have the vigor and hope of a healthful young
mission.</p>

<p>There are two other special features of their
mission worthy of note. They have strongly-fortified
themselves with Christian schools, one
of the most potent agencies for breaking down
Buddhism. Buddhist schools must be met by
Christian schools.</p>

<p>Then, they require five years’ service from
every young man entering their mission before
they allow him to marry. This gives a period of
probation at small outlay of money, and insures
that the young man will acquire the language and
be safely proven worthy and suited to his calling
before the mission becomes responsible for his
family. It has one disadvantage. When the
young missionary does marry, his wife is a novice
in the land, wholly unacquainted with the people
and their language, and can hardly hope to become
her husband’s helpmate, as she could have
done if they had entered upon their missionary
life together. Yet, on the whole, it is a policy
worthy of careful study and wider application.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span></p>

<p>This outline of missions in Burma leaves much
more unwritten than it records. It is only intended
to give a general survey of the forces that are gathering
which shall make the Burmese, the Shans,
the Karens, the Chins, and all the nations and
tribes truly Christians. They all aim at the speedy
redemption of this stronghold of Buddhism with
its attendant demonology.</p>

<span class="subhead">The Methodist Episcopal Mission, Burma</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Methodism</span> was established in Rangoon in
1879. Unlike any other mission known to
the writer, Methodism began its work in Burma,
as in some other places in India, without any financial
support or any community of Methodistic sentiment
or tradition among the people to depend
upon. It is true that there are a few persons in
Rangoon who had known of the wonderful work
done in Calcutta under Dr. Thoburn, and had repeatedly
invited him to come to Rangoon to
preach. William Taylor had sent out Mr. and
Mrs. Carter from America to begin self-supporting
work among the English-speaking people in Rangoon.
At this juncture, Dr. Thoburn went over
to Rangoon and laid the foundation of Methodism
in that city. He always remembers, with cordial
appreciation, the kindness of the Baptist missionaries
in receiving him and giving him the use of
their chapel in which to preach until the size of the
congregation required a larger building. Then he
went to the municipal hall where he arranged the
first Methodist society within two weeks of his
first service.</p>

<p>The beginnings were very encouraging. Of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
the English-speaking Churches which Methodism
has organized in India, that at Rangoon was the
largest in numbers and most diverse in its membership
at the beginning. Some of these original
members remained with us for nearly a score of
years. Some of them proved their loyalty and
faithful service through long years and under all
changes.</p>

<p>The self-support of this Church has been somewhat
remarkable. The Government gave the site
for the church and parsonage, and the first year
a plain, wooden church edifice was erected, and
also a parsonage by its side. Mr. Carter was succeeded
by Mr. Robinson as pastor. Under this
pastorate all that had been done previously was
conserved and new undertakings were begun. The
church and parsonage buildings were paid for and
the Church taught Methodist usages. Considering
that very few of the members, if any, had any
previous knowledge of the doctrines, this instruction
was most necessary.</p>

<p>From the very first until the present, a period
of twenty-one years, the Church has supported
its pastor with a modest salary. If part of that
time there has been a supplemental amount paid
by the Missionary Society, this has always been
more than offset by the real missionary work done
by the pastorate. Much of the time the pastor has
been presiding elder of the district, and always
he has had more than his pastorate to care for.</p>

<p>Rev. Mr. Robinson, aided by his devoted wife,
had four years of labor in care of the Church and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
the affairs of the mission. During this busy period
he began a girls’ school for the English-speaking
children and also a mission to seamen. These two
institutions were begun in a modest way as works
of faith and without buildings or funds for running
expenses. They were both launched to meet
a great need. Here again the liberality of the congregation
and the community of Rangoon friendly
to an active evangelism was exemplified in the contributions
to support both of these institutions.
Here, as in the case of the church, the Government
was generous in its aid of the school. It
was at this time the Government was extending
its newly-organized educational department and
felt generous in its plans for schools already organized.
A very desirable piece of land was given
the mission to be used for our girls’ school. But
a building was to be erected, and our people had
no funds. At that time the thought of receiving
mission money from America was not entertained
by any. After giving the land, the Government
gave over half the cost of the first school building,
and the people of Rangoon and vicinity gave the
remainder of the required funds. This has been
the order almost throughout our experience as a
mission. Support of all English branches of our
work has been secured almost entirely in Burma.</p>

<p>It was impossible for a single missionary family
to do all the work required. The first re-enforcement
sent to this field was Miss Warner, who
did enduring work in successfully superintending
this school in its infancy. Afterward she moved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
to another part of India, having been married to
Rev. D.&nbsp;O. Fox, with whom she continues in
effective missionary service.</p>

    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After four years of service in Rangoon, Rev.
S.&nbsp;P. Long came to aid Mr. Robinson, and took
work among the seamen, and assisted Mr. Robinson
in his increasing labors. The “Seamen’s Rest”
became a resort for many officers and sailors, and
in all its years no seafaring man ever received
aught but good in this institution. No class of
men so much need wholesome surroundings in
a seaport. It will surprise American readers to
know that many of the Sailors’ Homes and like institutions,
maintained often at Government expense
in these Asiatic ports, sell liquors to the sailors
who seek shelter within their walls. Thus the
sailors meet one of their worst enemies in the
house of their professed friends. The Seamen’s
Rest has sheltered and protected sailors through
all these years. So well did it do its work that,
even to this day, men who found Christ in the
services maintained in the Rest and on board ships
years ago, return to tell us of the glad experience
of those days. So well is the work done that the
Government for years past has given money to
pay the rent, and, sometimes, additional aid. More
hard work without adequate remuneration has
been done by the superintendents and managers
of this seamen’s institution during its nearly eighteen
years of good service, than in any other institution
I have ever known in any land. It has
secured these workers almost always from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
membership of the English Church. The mission
to seamen should be regarded as a part of the
Church’s activity. It is such work as this, in ways
too numerous to record, that this congregation
has fostered, that led Bishop Thoburn to write,
some years ago, “The Rangoon congregation is
the best working Church I have known in any
land.”</p>

<p>In 1886, Mr. Robinson, after six years of most
useful labor in Rangoon, transferred to India, and
Mr. Long took charge of the Church in addition
to his other duties. For nearly four years he met
the requirements of his position in the strength of
Christian manliness. One event of signal importance
occurred during his incumbency. A courageous
young woman came out from America and
became his wife. She was a companion to her
husband in all his arduous labors. But early in
1890, Mrs. Long’s health having broken down
under conditions of living already developed, which
prostrated the writer and his wife two years later,
they were compelled to return to America, leaving
the results of a memorable service in Burma. Mrs.
Long’s health never being fully regained, they
could not return to Burma. But it is a joy to all
their friends to know that they have been signally
successful in the pastorate at home.</p>

<p>The girls’ school prospered during this period
also, under the care of Miss Julia E. Wisner, who
succeeded to the principalship at the marriage of
Miss Warner. She was aided by Miss Files, who
came later, when it became evident that one woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
could not endure the multiplied burdens of such a
school. These ladies, as also Miss Warner, were
sent to Burma by the Woman’s Foreign Missionary
Society, which has done so much to aid all the
missions of the Methodist Episcopal Church.</p>

<figure id="i_223" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img src="images/i_223.jpg" width="2116" height="1169" alt=" ">
    <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Charlotte O’Neal Institute, Rangoon</span>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Early in the administration of Mr. Long it became
evident that the school must be divided. A
number of orphans and destitute children had been
placed in our hands, and some of the patrons paying
full fees objected to their children being placed
on an equal basis with “orphans.” There arose
out of this protest, and out of the further fact that
the first building was much crowded, the necessity
of securing a second building. This was done
while only thirteen hundred dollars out of its entire
cost came from America. The remainder of the
five thousand dollars required was secured by subscription
in Rangoon. This building was known
as the “Orphanage,” under separate management
from the school, except that all the children had
the same class-room privileges. During 1899, Miss
Fannie Scott was sent out to take charge of the
Orphanage. She continued most devotedly at her
post until failing health required her transfer to
India, in September, 1891, where she has done
faithful service since. Miss Perkins succeeded Miss
Scott in charge of the Orphanage.</p>

<p>During the last year of Mr. Long’s service in
Burma, he was joined by Mr. Warner, who came
to be his assistant. On the departure of Mr. Long,
Rev. R.&nbsp;C. Chancy was transferred to Burma, to
be the head of the mission and pastor of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
Church. But the year 1890 was to witness frequent
changes in the small band of workers. Miss Wisner,
owing to failing health, went on furlough with
the Longs, while the management of the school fell
to Miss Files. Mrs. Chancy was ill when they arrived
in Rangoon, and the old parsonage was a
most unfit place for a well person to live, much less
a sick mother with the care of a family. But as it
was the only residence in the mission, and the
Missionary Society had not then, nor has it yet,
been able to help us in acquiring houses for our
missionaries, it could not be helped. Mr. Chancy
pushed the mission work vigorously; but he was
compelled to leave Burma for America for his
wife’s health at the end of six months. Even then
he was too late. He only reached the shores of
California to see her slip away to the other world.</p>

<p>Mr. Warner took charge of the work as best
he could, though it would have been too much for
a far more experienced man. He held the post
until the arrival of the writer the last day of this
year, as noted elsewhere. Mr. Warner’s short administration
was embarrassed by the defection of
a young woman to another mission, after she had
been with us but a very few months, having been
sent out to take up Burmese. Singular that he and
his wife should follow in her footsteps soon after.</p>

<p>When our party of three landed in Burma, we
constituted the largest number of re-enforcements
received from home by our mission at any one time
in its history. This fact shows that the mission has
not been well sustained by the home Church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span></p>

<p>The most important personal experiences of
myself and family during the first two and a half
years have been given elsewhere. I only wish to
emphasize a few facts learned in that pastorate of
six years. The Church was well attended during
nearly all that time, and often crowded. The congregation
was such a collection of humanity as
I believe can be found in few other places in the
world. But the very variety gave life to it, and
inspiration to the preacher. Sailors and soldiers,
wanderers from every land, English, Irish, Scotch,
German, Scandinavian, Americans, were all in the
audience at once with Burma’s own score of differentiated
humanity. Once, of nine penitents in one
meeting, six different nationalities were represented.
As I look back now, two classes have
impressed me more than any others of my auditors.
The one class was the faithful ones of diverse racial
descent who were regular in their attendance, and
could be depended on for any and every service
the Church requires. They do not realize how
valuable just this kind of service is. In any land
it takes first place in worthy Christian fidelity. It
is far above social prestige, money, or even bright
talent. But in Burma, when in the nature of the
case there is so much instability among many, this
fidelity becomes the very pillar of the Church. Our
Rangoon Church has some such as worthy and as
faithful men and women as any missionary pastor
they have ever had.</p>

<p>The other class that impressed me was the
Scotchmen, who have sat in that congregation during<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
those years. I had not personally had much
acquaintance with the sons of this distinguished
branch of our race before going to Burma. Some
of the wisest counsels I have ever received were
from Scotchmen in Rangoon. Warm friendships
that I cherish highly grew out of this acquaintance.
On land and sea I have some scores of
Scotch friends, made while in the pastorate of Rangoon.
All these Scotchmen could listen to a sermon
and not grow weary, if there was anything in
it to rebuke, instruct, or inspire. The Scotch are
great “sermon tasters.” To have had their sterling
men in the congregation, in our home, to have
traveled with them oft by sea, and to have counseled
with not a few about the riches of “the kingdom,”
makes very precious memories of six busy
years.</p>

<p>For nearly four years of the six that I served
that Church, I had the joy of witnessing frequent
conversions at the regular services. These Sunday
evening congregations especially furnished
our chief opportunity to arrest attention and lead
men to God. Often weary and poorly prepared by
stress of work during the week, yet to preach to
a crowded house of attentive hearers, and knowing
that some of those present in every such congregation
had opportunity to enter a church but seldom,
and some who could attend such services
avoided God’s house except on occasions, lifted
the preacher to efforts beyond what he would ordinarily
be capable of giving. This Church had
among other good qualities the desire and expectation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
of seeing sinners converted, and rejoiced
when God gave new-born souls to their care.</p>

<p>Two more facts of importance in the acquisition
of property which occurred during my residence
in Rangoon may be noted. The one is mentioned
elsewhere as the purchase of residence property
in the cantonments, where we purposed also to
remove our boarding department of the Girls’
School. The other was the enlargement and connection
of the school and orphanage buildings in
the center of the town.</p>

<p>Miss Wisner had returned from furlough and
the school was prospering under her care, as was
the Orphanage under Miss Perkins. Both buildings
were too crowded for comfort, and provision
for more room was urgent. Just at this time a
man left two children on our hands, and advanced
payment on them. On application to the Educational
Department, we secured from the Government
an equal amount, and constructed an addition
connecting these two buildings. This completed a
general architectural design, and gave us a good
commodious row of buildings that furnished us
excellent accommodations for our large day-school.</p>

<p>It will be seen that in all these Rangoon enterprises
we are much indebted to the Government
and the Rangoon public for funds to plant the
Church, school, and Orphanage. The Government
and the community are in turn much indebted to
us for founding these same institutions and maintaining
them. But all this work was done with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
only thirteen hundred dollars from America. The
knowledge of these facts has been slowly understood
in America. It has in some cases had exactly
the opposite effect from what it should have had.
Since we have been able to accomplish so much
without much aid from America, it has been taken
for granted that we needed no mission money. The
result has been that for twenty-one years we have
received less money, in proportion to the work
done or the importance of the mission, than perhaps
any other field of any Church. It ought to
be that most help should go to those who do most
for themselves; but the fact that we have done
much to help ourselves has until recently had exactly
the opposite effect on the people at home.</p>

<p>During my pastorate in Rangoon I had many
evidences of the advantageous location of our
church. It is centrally placed and open to every
good cause, and so became a gathering place for
the common religious interests of Rangoon. This
was markedly true of the temperance gatherings
for a term of years. One gathering of this sort was
especially memorable. The Hon. Mr. Caine, the
great English temperance advocate, visited Burma,
and he addressed a public meeting in the interests
of temperance. This meeting was held in the
Methodist church, which was crowded, though
it began at a late hour. Only one other English
church in Rangoon would have been open to a
meeting like this. The Church is Methodistic to
the fullest degree, but forms a common rallying
ground for the united Church interests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span></p>

<p>At the end of 1896 I was succeeded in the pastorate
by Rev. C.&nbsp;T. Erickson, who had, with his
wife, just arrived from America for this pastorate.
The general work of superintending the district,
together with the pastorate, always was too much
for one man, and yet I had been laden with that
double task for six years. Mr. Erickson’s coming
was in answer to my often repeated request, and
gave me corresponding relief. He took up the
pastorate, and I had the opportunity to give attention
to district interests. The people were as much
relieved as myself, as they wanted a pastor who
could give his whole time to them. But in a few
months all our plans were disconcerted again by
the return to America of Mr. and Mrs. Erickson,
on account of the latter’s health. Just at that time
we had some prospects of getting other recruits
to our mission from America, so Mr. Schilling was
called in from the Burmese work to supply the
English Church for a few months, until Mr. and
Mrs. Hill, our expected re-enforcements, arrived.</p>

<p>Once more we were in a difficulty about the
principalship of the school. Miss Wisner, who had
been in failing health for some time, was arranging
to go home on a much-needed furlough, and Miss
Keeler, who had been teaching in the school for
four or five years since her arrival from America,
being needed in her department as teacher, we
were in great perplexity to secure a principal for
the school. Conference was in session about this
time at Calcutta, and after much deliberation it
was decided to do a very unusual thing. Mr. and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
Mrs. Hill were nearing the shores of India. Mrs.
Hill was appointed principal of the school. She
had never been in India before, and hence could
have had no experience in our school affairs, or
Indian life. But Mr. Hill had been brought up
in India, and had had an intimate acquaintance
with schools, and he could advise her in school
management. Mr. Hill took the pastorate of the
English Church, and Mrs. Hill conducted the
school for nearly a year very satisfactorily. The
pastorate of Mr. Hill was also successful from the
first, and has continued until the present.</p>

<p>Toward the end of 1888 the mission was re-enforced
by Miss Turrell, who came out from England
to take the principalship of the school. She
is an experienced educator, and enjoys the distinction
of being the first missionary among us
who has gone forth at her own charges, donating
her own passage money and services. In the
great generosity on her part she deserves the cordial
thanks of our entire mission, and especially
the good women at home whose work she had
done until the present time in the place of one of
their own missionaries. Early in 1899, Miss Files
returned from her furlough with Miss Charlotte
Illingworth, one of our own Rangoon girls, who
came back from college in America to take up
work as a missionary in the land and school of her
early training. Miss Keeler retired from missionary
work and, after a visit to America, returned
and was married, and lives in Rangoon. After one
year’s service in the school, Miss Files was transferred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
to India, and is teaching in the Wellesley
Girls’ School at Naini Tal.</p>

<p>This somewhat detailed record of the labors of
our missionaries in Rangoon and the institutions
they have built up has been given, because a connected
setting forth of this work has never been
made. A new mission as ours is often small, and
the importance of the several missionaries and
their earlier work is not always appreciated until
years afterward, when perhaps the exact date can
not be recalled. It is the writer’s purpose to make
mention of all the missionaries married and single,
who have been sent to Burma under the Missionary
Societies of the Methodist Church during the
first twenty-one years of our work there. To do
this it has been most convenient to give at the
same time the planting and growth of our English
work in Rangoon, with which, either in Church,
school, or Orphanage, all but a very few of our
missionaries have begun their labors. Those few
exceptions will have mention in the two following
chapters.</p>

<p>The fact that Methodism in Burma was founded
on self-supporting English work, and so continued
for the most part still, has the advantage of that
self-support long before the Missionary Society
could have done anything in the country, and of
holding the position for later developments, and
also in securing properties from the Government
for church and schools at a time when such grants
could be obtained. In all these respects, as well as
in initial evangelism among English-speaking peoples,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
our mission has done nobly, and has been
cordially approved by all its friends. I am free to
say that our people, as a whole, could not have
done more under the conditions under which they
have worked. More than that, if we could not
have entered the field as we did and worked as we
have, there would have been no representatives
of American Methodism in Burma to this day.
Hundreds of people who have been converted, and
thousands who have been uplifted by our preaching
and teaching, would have been the poorer by
so much as our Church and school have brought
them. Many poor and destitute whom we have
clad and fed and taught would have missed the
protection and shelter we gave them. Many
strangers who have found friends in times of temptation
in a strange and wicked city, would have
missed such friends. Earth and heaven are richer
for this score of years of faithful work of our
little mission.</p>

<p>But this plan of founding a mission has its
serious disadvantages, which are now being realized.
The foreign missions must have the Christless
peoples leaning on false faith as their great
objective. To reach this goal quickly and work it
permanently, it is of vital importance to master
the language of the people among whom you work.
Happy is the missionary who has been able to
devote his greatest efforts to this end during the
first year of his life in his chosen field. He should
lay a foundation in this period on which a mastery
of the language is easily possible. To do this he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
must be freed from other labors and all great responsibilities
for the welfare of the mission. This
opportunity has been lost to all our missionaries
who have been plunged into the English first.
The responsibilities in every post are extremely
exacting. The climate exacts its tribute of
strength, and when the large measure of exhausting
labor in the school or varied pastoral duties
has been met, there is neither time nor strength
to apply on a language. So it comes to pass that
every such missionary finds himself at a loss as the
years move around, and he finds he can not preach
to the people in their own tongue. The time has
come when we must give the new missionaries a
chance at the language as their first and most important
undertaking.</p>

<span class="subhead">Preaching in Four Asiatic Languages</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">In</span> other chapters are given the facts concerning
the beginnings and development of the English
work in Rangoon. The beginning among the
natives is of equal interest to the inquirer after
missionary information. When a mission without
resources begins operations in a foreign country,
it may be supposed that it would be very modest
in its undertaking. But in the case of Methodism
in Burma, and some other parts of Southern Asia
as well, rightly or wrongly, it has pursued exactly
the opposite course. With a mere handful of
workers, including missionaries and their helpers,
our people have from the beginning undertaken
about every kind of mission work possible. Within
two weeks from the time Bishop Thoburn landed
in Rangoon he had organized an English Church
of seventy members and probationers, and from
the membership thus brought together there were
volunteer workers raised up to preach among peoples
of three different native languages. As the
streets were always thronged with these people, it
was always easy to get a congregation. This hopeful
beginning was in perfect keeping with the
theory of missions long in vogue in a large portion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
of India—that from these self-supporting English
Churches there would be raised up the workers
who would evangelize the heathen peoples around
them. William Taylor was the great apostle of
this policy, and most of the Methodist missions not
included in the North India Conference were
founded on this theory by him and those that
caught his spirit.</p>

<p>This theory has fatal defects we now know,
but it was believed and put to the test in the way
indicated; and while it did not succeed in accomplishing
all that it was hoped at the beginning, it
did accomplish more than any other theory of missions
has done in the same time in proportion to
the number of missionaries employed, while its
expenditure of mission money for years was almost
nothing. This movement carried Methodism into
every city in Southern Asia that had a considerable
English-speaking population. It gave us English
Churches in all these centers. Our methods
aroused other missions to do more for these people
than they had ever done before. More than this,
it committed us to general mission work over this
area, and that with no outlay of mission money
until safe foundations were laid in all the centers
occupied.</p>

<p>Moved by this impulse and flushed with the
warmth of a great revival, these laymen in Rangoon
began to preach in Tamil, Telegu, and Hindustani.
It will be noticed that all these are languages
of India proper, indicating that these English-speaking
laymen had themselves come from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
India, and so were familiar with the languages of
the native immigrants to Burma. But most of
our English-speaking laymen were from Madras
or the Telegu country, so that the preaching in
Tamil and Telegu were continued; but for a long
time we were unable to keep a layman interested
who could preach in Hindustani, and it was discontinued,
except at irregular intervals.</p>

<p>There were converts from among the heathen
Tamil and Telegu people from the start. They
were baptized, and later on some Church organizations
were formed and some schools kept for
the children of these people. Preaching was kept
up in the English Church and at half a dozen other
places in Rangoon; in Dalla, across the Rangoon
River from Rangoon, among the coolies in the
mills, and in the jungle villages, and in Toiurgoo,
and later in Pegu on the railway. The Tamils and
the Telegus were generally found together, and
we could sometimes get a layman who could preach
in both languages, though generally we had to
engage different preachers.</p>

<p>As time went on we learned several important
facts about these people and this work that we did
not know at first. We very soon discovered that
we lost heavily among our converts by these immigrants
returning to their own land, and that our
people were not so distributed in India that they
could care for them in their native land on their
return. But this continual loss made it out of the
question to hope for much permanency in this kind
of work. Another weakness was that the men did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
not bring their families with them. And while we
got the men converted, they were still connected
with heathen relatives in India to whom they
would return. But the immediate weakness was
in the fact that there were few women and children
to complete the Christian families and Christian
communities. So family life, school, and Sunday-school
work was not possible.</p>

<p>As the work extended somewhat, we were met
by the fact that we must depend on paid agents,
and could not hope to go beyond a very narrow
limit by unpaid volunteer preaching and subpastoral
care. Applicants for such places were not
wanting. Many of these men in course of years
applied, and in turn were found, with few exceptions,
wholly unfit for permanent responsibility.
In the case of the Tamils especially, this was true.
The breakdown of this class of mission employees
was nearly complete. This was due to two causes.
The one seems to be in the Tamil race itself. They
do seem to lack the element of reliability generally
in everything that has not the highest monetary
value attainable as its goal. It is astonishing how
many of these employees failed us at this point.
There was the further difficulty, in that we had
to employ the men who drifted into Burma as the
dislodged members of other missions in India, who
were either unwilling to accept the regulations of
their own missions, or were not of its better material.
We seldom employed a man without certificate
of character, and we imported some agents
under special recommendation; but our experience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
with them was generally unsatisfactory for the
highest interest of the mission. But I am happy
to record that some were very true and reliable.</p>

<p>But the greatest weakness was on our part, in
being unable to give the missionary supervision
necessary to insure the highest success. We have
never been strong enough to give a missionary
to this work among immigrants to Burma. Without
this close missionary supervision, we can not
hope to succeed largely. Then we did not have
the money to extend the work largely so as to
acquire the momentum, and that would place at
our disposal enough candidates to enable us to
sift them and employ only the most worthy. But
a great deal of good has been done with a very
little outlay of money, and this work will be continued,
though only incidental to the larger mission
plans. We must make the Burmese people our
real objective.</p>

<p>For reasons already given, we have been slow
in taking up work among the Burmese people.
These reasons were in brief, too few missionaries
to spare even one man or woman to make the beginning,
and for years no missionary appropriation
at all was made to Burma. When a little money
was given us, we made the best use of it. But we
did baptize Burmese before we had any missionary
appropriations or missionary to these people.
Some inquirers from several miles out on the Pegu
River came into Rangoon, and sought out our
missionaries. Bishop Thoburn being in Rangoon
at the time, a boat was secured and a party made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
up to visit the village and investigate this new
opening. The village was found, and the bishop
preached, with a young Eurasian girl as his interpreter.
The interest created was considerable, and
before the day was over several candidates were
baptized. The initial step could not be followed
up as we could wish, but two years later I arrived
in Burma, and after some months was able to
visit this village and the surrounding country. It
was a great joy to find some of these converts still
true to all they knew of the gospel. One of them
could read the Bible, and he had a copy of the
good Book and some good tracts. Later on in
this region, but a little further from Rangoon, we
had our first considerable awakening among the
people.</p>

<p>In Rangoon we had one Burmese boys’ school,
which for two or three years gave promise of much
usefulness. These boys came from the country
and city, and were bright young lads from nine to
fifteen years of age. They were instructed in the
secular studies, and at the same time taught the
Bible. A Sunday-school was kept up also. If
this school could have been well cared for under
a missionary who knew the language, it could have
become largely useful and permanent. It finally
was broken up by the Burmese teacher going
wrong. But if a trained missionary had been in
charge, another teacher could have been employed
and the school sustained. During the continuance
of this school there were a number of boys baptized
in the school, and that with their relatives’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
knowledge, and there was no special opposition to
it. Bishop Thoburn was much impressed with this
fact, as such an occurrence in one of the schools
in India among the Hindu or Mohammedan boys
would have broken up the school. In all the
schools we have had, mostly in large villages in
the district, the same accessibility to the young
Burman has been found.</p>

<p>Among the missions which have become strong
enough to found a good school or system of
schools, they find not only that the Burmese are
ready to send their boys and pay the fees according
to the Government school code, but that these
same schools are the best missionary agencies,
both for the conversion of the Burmese and the
Christian training of prospective preachers and
teachers. For the latter, years under immediate
Christian training are indispensable. As Buddhism
is founded on a system of monastic schools, where
the boys are indoctrinated in the teachings of that
faith, it would seem that any policy which looks
to the overthrow of Buddhism should contemplate
replacing these Buddhist schools with Christian
schools. And when we find the Buddhists themselves
seeking education in Christian schools, and
willing to pay good fees for the privilege, the prospect
for the Christian schools becoming the greatest
auxiliary of evangelism is very encouraging.
It is my conviction that no nonchristian country
in the world presents the prospect of extensive
usefulness of the Christian system equal to Burma.</p>

<p>So eager were we to begin mission work among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
the Burmese, that we took up with whatever opening
presented itself. So sure were we that we
would not get the ear of the home Church, and so
get the necessary funds really to establish the
Burmese mission work, that we were ready to accept
whatever the field offered that promised to
give us access to the Burmese people.</p>

<p>Our first opportunity was thrust upon us. We
embraced it with perhaps too much eagerness.
But this is a question raised in the light of subsequent
experience which no man could foresee. In
the early part of 1893, I received a message from
the deputy commissioner of the Pegu District,
saying that he was opening a large tract of newly-drained
rice land to settlement and cultivation in
his district, and if I would start a colony of Burmese
cultivators on it, he would put at the disposal
of the mission from two to three thousand acres
of land. This was a very singular proposition, as
I had never seen that official but once, and had
never been in that part of his district, and had not
planned such an undertaking. I went up and made
a hurried investigation of the region, and found it
a part of a large plain that for a short time each
year had too much water for even rice cultivation,
which grows in water often a foot deep. The Government
felt certain its new drainage canals, dug
at considerable expense, would drain this plain.
And as its soil was the most fertile possible, and
covered with a light grass, which would easily yield
to the ordinary native plow, it seemed desirable to
co-operate with the district officials, and take up a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
large section of the land. The deputy commissioner
offered to put at our disposal three thousand
acres of land, for which we were to have a title
as soon as we put it under cultivation. Having no
mission money of any account to go on in the conventional
method of founding a mission, it does not
at all seem to be wondered at that this inviting
offer of land was looked upon as a providential
way of founding an industrial mission.</p>

<p>Just at this time, in a thickly-populated part of
the district, some forty miles away, a company of
twenty-eight Burmans, whom I had not seen before,
sought me out, and asked me to help them
get some land. Taken with the offer of the land
by the district officer, it seemed a rare opportunity
to get forward with our mission.</p>

<p>The season being far advanced, it was imperatively
necessary to act quickly because these Burmans
had to make their arrangements for the year,
and the opportunity to get this land or any other
so well situated we thought would never come
again. This combination of urgent features led
us to take the land and make the venture at once.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of planning to launch
such a scheme. We did not want to be involved
financially. We did want to lay a good foundation
of evangelism and to establish schools. The plan
finally adopted was that we were to aid the Burmans
in their dealings with the Government, and
in selling their rice. We were to furnish schools
for their children and to preach to them. But we
were not to become financially involved, either for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
the running expenses of the colony, or for the tax
due the Government. The plan was one of mutual
helpfulness. To this plan all parties cheerfully
agreed.</p>

<p>It was nearly time for the rains to begin when
the papers were secured allowing us to move upon
the land. Meantime a good many of the people
who would have gone with us a month earlier
dropped out during the delay in getting the land.
But we succeeded in gathering one hundred and
twenty people, and moved on to the land about
the first of May. We still had time to build a village
out of the bamboo poles and thatch, out of
which these cultivators’ houses are always made.
This was rather a hopeful beginning, and we had
assurance of twice as many people to follow.</p>

<p>Just at this time we met with an example of the
careless disregard of a financial obligation often
found in the Burman. His cool indifference to a
promise, however well secured, is frequently refreshing
in its audacity. The Burmans were to
furnish all the cattle to work the land. We were
to lay out no money whatever on the business features
of the colony. Four head men of the colony
had been recognized by the deputy commissioner.
They had pledged <em>two hundred cattle</em> security for
the tax due on the land. Their cattle would have
been entirely sufficient to cultivate at least a thousand
acres the first year. But when the houses
were built and the colony began business, it became
clear that only a small number of these cattle
were really in the hands of the colonists. Their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
explanation was that many of the men having
most cattle dropped out, as the uncertainties of
getting the land for the crop remained over the
venture. This we learned later was true in part.
More of them had dropped out because they did
not want to put in all their cattle, while some of
the colonists had none, or only a few, and they
were heavily mortgaged.</p>

<p>But these men had pledged to the Government,
officially, cattle which they did not possess. In
this they deceived us, a not very difficult matter,
as we were new to the country and unacquainted
with the characteristics of the Burmese people.
But if we were deceived, the deputy commissioner
had more reason to regret having been duped, as
he was an officer in the province for many years,
and supposed he knew the Burman. He also drew
up the revenue bond which they signed. He indeed
planned and extended this bond, entirely
apart from the revenue regulations, I believe.
Therefore, when we reproached ourselves in not
being as farsighted as we should have been, we
still could shield our humiliation behind the much
greater defeat of the pet measure of this official.</p>

<p>If we had been willing simply to save the mission
from all financial obligations, and retreat from
the enterprise without any dishonor, we could have
done so when we learned that these Burmans were
unable to carry out their part of the contract. But
it would have been equivalent to the utter collapse
of the enterprise. While we were in no way financially
obligated to meet what they had failed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
meet under our general agreement, yet in my mind
I have never been convinced that it would have
been the wisest thing to do, even if we could have
foreseen the final outcome, which we did not at
that time even suspect. Then every honorable
man must give his character to the enterprise he
launches.</p>

<p>Our second surprise came only a few weeks
later. I had secured money outside of mission
funds, for we had none of the latter, and bought
sufficient cattle for the colony. This was beyond
all our agreement. The men began work well
enough, and soon had a promising beginning of
cultivation. As the young rice began to show in
the fields, the water which had been slowly rising
over the plain during the increasing rains suddenly
covered all the fields to a dangerous depth. A
foot of extra water will not hurt much if it goes
down within two or three days. But this flooding
of our land covered a score of square miles of the
country. Then it slowly dawned on us that the
Government engineers’ drainage system was a failure,
and with it our colony was doomed. We had
depended upon the work of the engineers, and
their canals could not carry off the water, and we
were the sufferers. The colony slowly melted
away while the water remained.</p>

<p>Let it be noted that though the Burmans failed
us, and some of our acutely sympathetic friends
have assured us all these years that this failure of
the Burmese character was inevitable, yet it was
the failure of the work of the Government engineers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
that destroyed our colony. The Burmans
were at work until the floods came, and they remained
weeks after all ordinary hope of making a
crop was gone; while the failure of the drainage
scheme developed early, and the whole plain remained
flooded for six years until supplementary
canals were dug. If we failed by overconfidence in
the adroit Burman, we failed with double effect
when we trusted to the skill of the Government
engineers.</p>

<p>A very unpleasant incident occurred about the
time the colony was drowned out. The deputy
commissioner, who had gone out of his way to
induce us officially to enter upon this colony
scheme, turned against us in a very unaccountable
way. He misrepresented our undertaking to his
superiors. He accused us of exacting oppressive
terms of the Burmans, when the exact opposite
was true. We had gone far beyond all our agreement
with them, and gave them better terms than
any other people ever gave to any cultivator in
Burma. In the end it was easy enough to show
wherein this unwise official was wholly in error.
But it was not until his official opposition had
wrought its work on scattering the colony, and
had made success in recognition impossible. This
episode is an unpleasant matter to record. I would
omit it entirely if it did not bear a vital relation to
the defeat of a missionary enterprise. But I am
glad to be able to say that he is the only official
of British blood who ever gave our mission or
missionaries in Burma during my experience there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
any annoyance or ungenerous treatment in a business
way. The officials have been courteous gentlemen
always, and I have been much in business
transactions with all classes of them for a decade.
Our missionaries of long experience in other parts
of the empire have been delighted in making much
the same report.</p>

<p>While the colony was broken up and scattered
in a way that forebade us to hope for any good to
result from our undertaking, it was not really so
bad as we believed at the time. We had not baptized
any of the colonists, though a number of
them had indicated that they wished baptism in the
early beginnings of the colony. When they scattered
abroad in the country doubtless they made
reports very discouraging. But we have much
reason to know that there came to be quite a general
feeling that we had sought the good of the
people. There have been many evidences of this,
but that which is clearest proof, is that every year
since Burmans in the same neighborhood have
urged us to undertake some such enterprise again.
But there were other evidences.</p>

<p>The colony was begun in April, 1893, and was
abandoned entirely by the end of the year. Just
at this time Rev. G.&nbsp;J. Schilling and wife came to
us to take up the Burmese work. I had been the
only man among our small band of missionaries
for nearly three years. My assistants were supplies
picked up in the country. I got very weary
often with the heat and much work. But I was
often worn greatly for lack of counsel in the responsibilities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
of the mission. There have always
been some of the truest friends among the laymen
in Rangoon, but naturally they can not take the
responsible care of the mission. The coming of
Mr. and Mrs. Schilling was a great joy to me and
all our lady missionaries.</p>

<p>A little incident occurred the second day after
the arrival of our friends, which shows the playful
side of missionary life. They arrived in the afternoon,
and early next morning I took Mr. Schilling
with me a day’s journey by steam launch
through one of Lower Burma’s many tidal creeks
to a village where we had some Christians. We
were so busy we did not allow the new missionary
even a day to look around the city of Rangoon,
but hurried him immediately into the district. I
had the journey planned, and could not delay the
trip for pressure of work in the city.</p>

<p>At six o’clock in the evening we arrived at the
village of Thongwa, a place of five thousand people.
After some three hours’ looking about the
town we were tired, and as always in Burma when
taking exercise, very much heated. I proposed
a swim in the river to cool us down so we could
sleep. Mr. Schilling, being a strong swimmer,
plunged out into the stream, and did not pause
till he reached the opposite side of the river. I,
being a very moderate swimmer, remained near
the shore. But I was impressed with the dark
river lined with palm-trees on a moonless night,
with no light except from the stars and a faint
glimmer from the lamps of the village. I wondered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
at the temerity of my fellow-missionary on this,
his first night in a tropical country! Perhaps I
was not wholly innocent in the practical joke I
attempted. Just as I heard a splash on the opposite
side of the stream I called out, “Brother
Schilling, I forgot to tell you that there are alligators
in this river.” There was a splash, a plunge,
and heavy breathing of a swimmer exerting all his
power in the haste to recross the stream. I was
amused at the effect of this bit of information on
the missionary recruit. But his amusement arrived
only as an afterthought. His first efforts were
all spent in getting to my side of the river. He
reasoned, “In haste there is safety.” When he recovered
his breath he told me that just as I shouted
“alligator” he had stepped on some slippery member
of the tribe that lives in the muddy ooze of all
tropical tidal creeks, and to his imagination the
word “alligator” made that squirming creature a
very real menace to his personal safety. There
were alligators in the stream, but they were several
miles further down and, as far as I knew, quite
harmless.</p>

<p>Another experience which befell some of us
some months before this had features about it too
grim for humor, but which may be recorded to
show the reality of life in a tropical land. Shortly
after the colony was flooded, I made one of my
visits to the people. Several times I had to travel
in a small boat, a dug-out log. To return to Rangoon
I took to the stream after nightfall, and traveled
within a mile or two of the railway, and then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
the current of the stream becoming too swift for
the oarsman, we took to the water, and waded
against the current until we reached the station.
The particular occurrence occurred when the water
was at its highest over an area many miles. The
occasion of my making these journeys at night
was that I could catch a train bringing me to
Rangoon in the morning for my many duties there.
As the whole country was flooded, we undertook
to guide our boat thirteen miles from the colony
to the railway all over an overflowed, treeless
plain. Our party consisted of a young Swiss I
had in charge of the colony, a Malay servant of
the Swiss, who acted as steersman, and a Telegu,
a very lazy man, who would not row, and so got a
free ride, grudgingly allowed by myself. The
Swiss and I had to do all the rowing, no easy task
through the protruding elephant grass, which rose
several feet above the water in some places. In
addition, I undertook to pilot the boat, the open
hollow-log canoe, always difficult to keep bottom
downward. Without any object to serve as a
guide, my own sense of locality, as we had no
compass, being my only resource, the downpour
of rain every half-hour—all made a combination
of circumstances calculated to fill us with doubts
as to our success in reaching the railway at all,
while the dark hours of the night passed slowly on.
We had no light with us, and at times it was exceedingly
dark; but the moon showed its half-filled
face occasionally. Late in the night we came
near to some abandoned grass hut. As an unusually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
heavy storm was approaching, revealed to us
by the beating of the rain on the quiet water of
the plain, we concluded to steer our unstable craft
in through the open doorway of the hut. There
were several feet of water in the hut and on the
adjacent fields. As the hut was large enough to
accommodate our boat and the roof was intact, we
hoped to have shelter until the rain had passed.</p>

<p>We had our misgivings, because we feared the
snakes, driven from the grass of the plain by the
water, would be finding quarters in the house.
This proved to be a very true surmise. We had
just got into the house, when our free passenger,
the Telegu, took out his matchbox and a cigar
and prepared to smoke. I thought I could use
that match to better advantage, and demanded it.
As the match flashed and then burned steadily for
a moment, we searched the thatch sides and roof
and bamboo supports for snakes. We were not
disappointed. Here and there were the glistening
coils of snakes tucked away; but our greatest
nervous shock came on looking immediately over
our heads, when we were startled to see a very
large snake coiled on top of the rafter, while the
glistening scales of his whitish belly were only two
or three feet above some of our heads. We immediately
prepared to leave this place in possession
of its venomous occupants. Softly we moved lest
we shake snakes into our boat. The Swiss was
very eager to avoid colliding with a post and shaking
a snake into the boat, especially as we were
all barefooted, having removed our shoes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span></p>

<p>We took to the storm again, the worst of that
weary wet night, thankful to have escaped keeping
company with the snakes. About one o’clock at
night we found the railroad, and rested until the
train came. I look back on that night’s experience
with vivid recollections. The long piloting of the
boat without guide of any kind for thirteen miles,
and then to have made our exact destination, was
no ordinary achievement, of which I have always
had some pride. The experience with the snakes
in the abandoned house seen by the flash of a
match makes a memory too vivid to avoid an inward
squirming to this day. These disconnected
experiences are given to break the monotony of
prosaic account of mission work, and to indicate
to the reader that there are realities in journeyings
about the inhabited parts of a tropical country calculated
to impress the memory.</p>

<p>Mr. Schilling’s coming to us was very timely.
He began Burmese very soon, in which Mr. Robertson
joined him. We at once planned to open a
station for a missionary outside of Rangoon. We
selected Pegu, a town on the railway fifty-six miles
from the capital city, and on the road to Mandalay.
We chose this town because it was the nearest station
to our broken-up colony, from which also
we could work another region which had been
given to the people for the colony, and from
whence we could reach half a hundred villages of
Burmans unsought by any missionary. We needed
a town, also, where we could have a physician for
the missionary’s family. A place was desired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
where land and missionary buildings could be secured
economically.</p>

<figure id="i_255" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 40em;">

    <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Large Image at Pegu</span>

</figure>

<p>Mr. Schilling was supported by the vigorous
missionary Church of Montclair, New Jersey.
They paid his passage and his salary, and for the
mission house. So prompt was their response and
so generous, that the mission was very greatly uplifted.
Mr. Robertson lived with Mr. Schilling,
and they both made rapid progress in learning the
language. In a few months inquirers began to be
found. Some lapsed Christians were picked up,
and they tried to work them into some Christian
usefulness. Before the end of the year they were
beginning to preach in the vernacular. Altogether
our prospect of doing mission work among the
Burmese was becoming promising, and we were all
filled with cheer.</p>

<p>Within a little more than a year each of these
brethren was doing aggressive evangelistic work.
Mr. Schilling remained at Pegu, and traveled somewhat
widely in the regions east and north. Mr.
Robertson was given the district south of Pegu and
east of Rangoon. He lived at Thongwa, the village
where our Burmese work was first undertaken in a
systematic way. Mr. Robertson had married Miss
Haskew, of Calcutta.</p>

<p>Mr. Schilling, at the suggestion of some of the
Burmese who had been with us in the colony enterprise,
organized a new movement to build a village
near the place where we had formerly located, but
not subject to floods, into which the Christians
and their families would move, separating the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
Christian community and providing a school for
their children. About one hundred and fifty people
came to the village, and a simple church was
built and a school begun. Quite a number of
these people were with us in the original enterprise,
and they and their friends had had some
Christian instruction. Mr. Schilling preached earnestly
to the village, and baptized about thirty people
in a few months’ time. So we came to have
a visible Christian community in the wake of our
colony scheme, and that within two years of our
first beginning. If, as we are accustomed to say,
we failed in the colony, still but for the colony we
would not have been in that region at all. If we
had not founded the colony, we would not have had
a village. We are encouraged this much, that
though we failed in our unusual departure in this
region for reasons stated, we had more to show at
the end of the two years from the failure than the
most successful enterprise on the conventional
mission lines that I know of in Burma has had
during an equal length of time at the beginning
of their history. If we count the money invested,
the same comparison holds good.</p>

<p>The village still exists, and though it has suffered
many vicissitudes, due in part to the nature
of pioneer mission work, and partly to lack of continuous
missionary direction, yet we have contact
with the entire community of that region, and
within the last year and a half our missionary in
charge has baptized a number of converts in the
village and community.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span></p>

<p>Before a year from the time he took up his
residence in Thongwa, Mr. Robertson’s health
failed seriously, and he had to give up his labors
and go to the hills of India. This was in 1896. At
first we thought he would soon be with us again;
but this was not to be. He has been kept in India
by the exigencies of his health at first, and latterly
by the exigencies of the work. The Thongwa circuit
has been supplied as best we could do it to this
day, and has never had continuous missionary
residence or supervision such as is needed. It has
had only such attention as could be given it by men
whose hands were more than full elsewhere.</p>

<p>During 1896 two young men were sent out by
individuals who wished to do a generous thing for
missions through a representative. Mr. Krull arrived
in April, and Mr. Swann came in October.
Much was hoped from this arrangement. The
young men were religious, and faithful in their
efforts. A mistake had been made in both cases,
in that neither man was educated sufficiently to
enable him to master a foreign tongue, or to meet
the responsibility of leadership. After a few
months the supporter of Mr. Swann declined to
pay the small salary he had agreed upon, and the
young man had to retire from the field, as he was
not sent out by the Mission Board. Mr. Krull
continued as an auxiliary mission agent for nearly
five years, for which he contracted, and his friend
loyally supported him to the end. Then, he being
convinced that he was not adapted to do the work
of a missionary, returned and began secular work.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
However, he still has responsibilities as a local
preacher.</p>

<p>These young men were not qualified for the
work for which they were chosen. In this they
were not to blame, as they could not have understood
the needs of a mission field. They were not
selected by a Mission Board. But the whole experience
is added to like experience elsewhere in
proof that the best way to aid missions is through
regular channels, or through men whose judgment
has been proven in responsible positions.</p>

<p>Mr. Schilling’s health was impaired during 1897,
and early in 1898 he and his family returned to
America. So within two years we lost two missionary
families from our ranks, greatly to the
distress of those that remained, and the detriment
of the entire work. Our promising beginnings
among the Burmese suffered most.</p>

<p>For a year we awaited re-enforcements. Early
in 1899, Rev. Mr. Leonard and wife were sent to
us from India. Mr. Leonard at once moved into
the mission-house at Pegu. Without delay he
began the study of the Burmese language, and as
he had high linguistic ability, he acquired a working
use of the language. Before the end of the
year he was preaching without an interpreter, and
was doing some necessary translation.</p>

<p>One of the first steps towards putting the Burmese
work on a better foundation was the beginning
of a school for the boys of our Burmese Christians.
For years I had hoped to see this done.
Pegu had been chosen for the residence of a missionary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
partly with this end in view, as it is accessible,
is free from some of the evils of a great city
like Rangoon, and simple habits of life can be maintained
more easily. The last is most important.
Expensive habits are so easily learned and so difficult
to unlearn, that we can not be too careful
about the training of the children of our Christian
community.</p>

<p>This school was begun with about six boys,
and soon grew to an attendance of twenty. Some
of these paid full school fees. Their instruction
was the best. They were given regular lessons in
secular subjects and daily Bible instruction. Much
of the latter was committed to memory. It would
surprise some of our Sunday-schools and some
of our Christian people to find how carefully the
Bible is taught in mission schools. Mr. Leonard
did most thorough work in this matter, and we
hope in this school to prepare for future service
promising boys. Those who know what it means
to work with the only material available in the beginning
of a mission can appreciate our solicitude
for enough properly-trained workers. These
preachers and teachers so much needed must come
from our own schools.</p>

<p>Mr. Leonard has been very successful in getting
access to the Burmese. He baptized more
than one hundred converts from Buddhism during
1900. This shows how accessible the Burmese
people are. If it were true that the Burmese have
been exceptionally hard to reach hitherto, it is
not so now. We have access to all classes of them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
and we are positive of winning them to Christ and
of founding our Church among them just as rapidly
as we can be re-enforced to do this work. Mr.
Leonard has twice the territory to look after that
one missionary should have.</p>

<p>Our latest work to be done is that among the
Chinese. We were led into this work by two circumstances.
In Rangoon we found a few Chinese
Christians who were not looked after by anybody,
and to these were added some of our own Chinese
converts from Malaysia and some from China. As
Rangoon and Burma are the natural termini of
the immigrants from China by sea and overland,
we have a large Chinese population in Rangoon,
and this same population is very evenly distributed
in all important villages of the province. These
Chinamen marry Burmese women, so that they
become identified with the Burmese people. As
we aimed at the conversion of the Burmese, it was
easy to begin preaching for those that were Christians,
and to fortify the foundation of our mission
to the Burmese.</p>

<p>As in other work, we had to employ just such
preachers as we could pick up. But in 1897 we
secured a young man trained by Dr. West, of Penang,
who has done faithful preaching in Rangoon
and vicinity. There have been some thirty baptisms
since he came to us. This work is so important
that it must be done by somebody. There
is a demand for as great a school for these people
as we have founded in Singapore or Penang. But
its support is not in sight.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV"><span id="toclink_263"></span>CHAPTER XV<br>

<span class="subhead">A Unique Enterprise</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">In</span> March, 1897, the Rangoon Orphanage was
removed to the Karen Hills, east of Tomgoo,
and established on an industrial basis, where it
has been maintained these four years under the
new plan, and it has become the “Unique Institution
of the East,” as one discerning official called it.</p>

<p>When one starts an enterprise that is entirely
new he is called upon for his reason for doing so.
So long as he proceeds exactly as other people, he
needs no apology. But in all conservative countries
to go contrary to “custom” is to invite criticism,
even if one’s efforts are an advance on the
established order. One curse of India is that its
people are enslaved by “custom;” and some of
these customs are very bad, and most of them are
wholly unprogressive. Custom has bound chains
on the people, and they have worn these chains so
long that they have come to love their bonds better
than liberty. In most matters “change” is undesired,
and to announce that a plan is “new” is
enough to condemn it hopelessly with many, and
to start a thousand tongues to attack it.</p>

<p>It has been shown elsewhere how pitiably situated
are the poor of European descent in all parts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
of Southern Asia, there is a greater percentage
of these poor dependent on some form of public
or private charity than among any people I know
of in any land. Perhaps in no country do the social
customs do more to unfit the poor to help themselves.
I am persuaded also that very much of the
charity of the country, of which there is a great
deal, is unwisely, if not harmfully, bestowed. Rangoon,
for instance, like all Indian cities, has a
charitable society made up of ministers and officials,
which dispenses a great deal of relief. Studying
its methods as a member for six years, I became
convinced that, while very much good was
done, the system pauperized a relatively large
number of people, who should have been self-sustaining.</p>

<p>In this general dependent condition of a large
part of these people, there is the ever-present and
acute distress of poor or abandoned children, for
which there have been established many Orphanages
and schools. All managers of these Orphanages
are appealed to by indolent or destitute parents
to give free schooling, including board and
clothing, to their children. The truly orphaned,
or the abandoned, children are always touching our
sympathies, and appealing irresistibly to us for aid.
The number of children born in wedlock, as well
as out of legal bonds, who are abandoned by parents
or legal relatives, is astonishingly large. The
result of all these combinations is to fill our Orphanages;
for the innocent child must not be
allowed to suffer all the consequences of others’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
sins. So the “Orphanages” are found everywhere
to care for these children of European descent,
whether they be Anglo-Indian or Eurasian.</p>

<p>The founding of the Methodist Orphanage in
Rangoon has been noted elsewhere. In managing
this Orphanage for a number of years after the
custom of the country, I became convinced that
while the amount of relief and protection given to
child-life during its earlier years was exceedingly
great, there was a very serious defect in the system
of conducting all such institutions. I have
intimated elsewhere how little ordinary work is
done by anybody of European extraction in the
whole of Southern Asia. This applies generally
to the schools, including even the Orphanages.
Everything that can be done by servants is delegated
to them. It may surprise many American
readers to know that “orphanages” and “homes”
for Eurasians in India depend on the work of
servants, and very little on the inmates, much as
other establishments of the country. This, too,
not only in those things where the work is beyond
the power of boys and girls to do, but in
many kinds of work which it is considered “improper”
or “undignified” for them to engage in.</p>

<p>It is considered right and proper for the girls
to learn to sew, in addition to learning their lessons,
and sometimes to arrange their own beds.
Some of them even learned to cook some kinds of
food, generally “curry and rice.” But to sweep,
or scrub a floor, or thoroughly to clean a house, to
wash or iron their own clothes, much less the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
clothes of others, or to take up cooking or dish-washing
as a regular task, is not thought of.
Those are “menial tasks;” a “servant should do
them.” What a lady of refinement and wealth in
a Western land often does from choice, even the
destitute depending on “charity” are ashamed to
do in Asia. To be dependent or even to “beg”
is no disgrace; but to be a cook, a nurse for a
lady, or housekeeper, unless aided by servants, is
considered a disgrace. Indeed, these kinds of work
are never done by any one unless under great extremities.
The boys and men are even less willing
to do the ordinary work of life. Clerkships and
such like only are considered “respectable” employment.</p>

<p>In all this it will be observed that the question
is not one of indolence or lack of energy, but one
of a social system. The individual is not so much
to blame. He does not do differently from his
neighbors. In the matter of the children, the
managers of the Orphanages are responsible, in
so far as they can resist the enfeebling social conditions
under which they work.</p>

<p>We then contemplated teaching the girls and
boys under our care to help themselves where
others depended on servants; to do this as a necessary
part of a well-rounded education. Of course,
we recognized the fact that we were undertaking
to modify the social order, universal among an
entire people. This was recognized as a very difficult
task, and nothing but a settled conviction that
the old order was fearfully defective led us to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
undertake it. Looking back now, we have much
interest in recalling the comments on this undertaking.
Many assured us that it was a work that
should be done, but would fail if undertaken.
Others wanted the girls especially trained for
housekeepers, “so we can be released from dependence
on the Madrassi servants.” This suggestion
was wholly philanthropic! Another said
several times: “What are you training those girls
for? For servants? I want some servants.” The
author of the latter remark has never made any
other contribution to the Orphanage so far as I
can learn. People who had always received something
for nothing, of whom there were many, were
opposed to the plan. The “prophets,” of whom
Asia has her share, were all against us. The
“loquacious oracles,” talking about what they did
not know, as was their habit, were all against us.
But we had a few friends who gave unqualified
encouragement. These were of two classes; one
a small company of brave missionaries, of whom
Bishop and Mrs. Thoburn were the representatives.
The other class were those who had done
most for and given most money to the Orphanage
on the old basis. These people who gave money
and sympathy, while others gave poor advice and
criticism, said, “If you only teach these boys and
girls to care for themselves, it will be the greatest
service to them.” We were led to follow the advice
of our friends, who really had the problem
on their hearts, and our own convictions, and so
ventured on this untried undertaking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span></p>

<p>The first consideration was to find a more suitable
location for our Orphanage. To have undertaken
to dispense with servants and all native
helpers, and to introduce an entirely new household
order in Rangoon, would have been to invite
such a degree of intermeddling by irresponsible
people, as we did not care to be annoyed with.
Besides, the climate in the plains is very hot, and
too oppressive for foreigners to do the extent of
physical labor required to pioneer such an undertaking.
The help that the boys and girls could
give at the beginning would be insignificant. We
sought a cooler climate. This could only be found
in hills high enough to lift you into a substantially
cooler and less oppressive atmosphere.</p>

<p>I had been making investigation in the hills of
Burma one hundred and sixty miles north of Rangoon,
for four years. The original object of this
investigation was to find a cool mountain retreat
to which our missionaries could go when worn
with their labor in the plains. Other parts of India
had well-established hill stations, but Burma had
none. In my own case, when health failed, I had
to go the long journey to India, and to remain
there many months. Had I been acquainted with
the hills of Burma, this could all have been avoided
by a change from the heat of the plains when I first
began to decline. After my return to Burma, I
determined to find such a place in Burma, if possible.</p>

<p>The first intimation of an accessible place came
to me on a visit to Tomgoo, where a member of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
my Church lived. His name was D. Souza, a pensioner
of the Indian Survey Department of the
Government. As this good brother was closing his
work prior to retiring from the service, he came to
survey Thandaung, a hill twenty-three miles northeast
of Tomgoo, the head of the district and a town
on the railway. Thandaung had been an experimental
garden under the Forestry Department
of the Government in the seventies, where cinchona
cultivation had been undertaken, also tea and coffee
had been planted. A school had been established
at Tomgoo, intended to teach the Karens how to
grow these products. Later the school was closed,
and the cultivation on the hills abandoned. At
that time Tomgoo was the military outpost, and
the authorities built a road to Thandaung, and
experiments with the place as a hill station for their
soldiers were made. When Upper Burma was
annexed in 1885, there was a great rush to Mandalay,
and later to regions beyond, where in the
regions of Upper Burma various attempts to open
military hill stations were made. Thandaung was
abandoned, but not till records had been made
very favorable to the place as a sanitarium for
Europeans. This record did good service for us
when we came to reinspect these hills.</p>

<p>Mr. D. Souza secured the most of the area of
the old cantonment and some of the buildings,
with a view of making a large coffee plantation.
He had begun operations early in 1893, and I
visited the place first in June of that year. For
four years I made frequent visits during different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
months of the year to test the climate thoroughly.
I found the climate in delightful contrast with the
plains at all times, and surprisingly invigorating
during most of the year. In this investigation I
was much aided by my former sojourn in three
of the hill stations of India—Almora, Naini Tal,
and Mussoorie. It has the altitude of the first and
a cooler temperature during the hottest weather
than either of the three, while from November to
May there is no fog and no rain.</p>

<p>I was convinced that this most accessible hill
in Burma would serve admirably for our double
need; a location for our industrial plans, for our
Orphanage, and a resort for tired missionaries.</p>

<p>By a vote of the Bengal-Burma Conference, I
was instructed to apply for land for the enterprise.
This Conference authority was sought because it
was a good thing to be “regular” in a new undertaking,
and to have the moral support of the Conference
when the difficult places in working out
the new scheme were reached. I learned afterward
that a good-natured brother remarked, “O yes,
vote him the authority to go ahead; he can only
fail anyway.” The Government gave us a lease
of one hundred acres of land for the new undertaking,
and preparations were begun to move the
Orphanage, together with the superintendent and
my own family, to this hill. But positive authority
to go to our new location was given at the Conference
session in February of 1897. It required
much haste to close up affairs in Rangoon connected
with the Orphanage, and make the move.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span></p>

<p>Before we actually took the train we allowed
all the children whose relations were unwilling to
have them go with us into this new location and
untried plan to depart from the school. Nearly a
dozen left us. People whose children had been fed
and clothed and schooled for years for nothing
were entirely unwilling to have them go into the
new location, where they were to learn to work
as well as to eat, and to a small extent work for
what they ate. We yielded to them, being conscious
all the time of the ingratitude displayed for
years of care of their children. Indeed, it is the
legitimate fruit of a system that gives everything
to dependent people and requires no service in
return, that they should come to take your service
and care as a right, without even a grateful acknowledgment
for favors. There are cases where
recipients of free care have taken the position that
they were conferring a favor on the missionaries
by remaining under their protection and care.</p>

<p>The experimental cinchona garden had grown
up in a young forest during the years since the
Forestry Department had abandoned it. The
roads were all overgrown with rank jungle. We
had a small space cleared and a hut erected, made
of bamboo mats, and supported on bamboo poles
with split bamboo used as tiles folded over each
other for a roof. The floor was two feet from the
ground, and consisted of split bamboos spread out
flat and laid on bamboo poles. This hut was expected
to protect us only during the month of
April, at the end of which the rains begin. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
arrived at Thandaung on March 24th, and took up
our abode in the primitive domicile. The whole
structure cost thirty dollars, and thirty-five people
moved into it, Miss Perkins, the principal of the
Orphanage, and the writer and his family included.
This furnished us house room at a cost of less
than a dollar each.</p>

<p>This frail shelter was only intended to serve
as a camping-place for five weeks at the longest.
I had planned for a better house than this, and a
month earlier I had given the contract for the
preliminary work of cutting and dragging timber
for the framework, thinking it would be possible
to secure some kind of permanent shelter early in
the rains. It is true this more substantial building
would have to be limited to what could be built
for three hundred dollars, as that was all we had in
sight for this new enterprise.</p>

<p>When we arrived on the mountain I found the
Karens, who had agreed to do the work of cutting
and dragging timber, had failed us entirely. But
the tropical rains did not fail. The monsoon is
always on time in Lower Burma. With the first
downpour all hope of building operations was
at an end.</p>

<p>In consequence we went into the long monsoon
in this temporary inclosure, by courtesy called a
house. We improved the shelter by laying some
sheets of corrugated iron on the roof, and weighting
them down with poles. In this house we kept
school, had our sleeping apartments, and did the
cooking and baking for this large family. At first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
boys and girls were rebellious against assisting in
household work, and one girl ran away twice, all
the twenty-three miles to the railway. The second
time we sent her permanently to her relatives.
But in good time much advance in orderly housekeeping
was made. Had meddlesome people not
followed us into even this isolated place, the work
of training would have been much easier. Work
for the boys was begun also. They cut the wood,
carried the water, and milked cows; also cultivated
vegetables, and we planted some eight thousand
coffee trees the first year. It was the intention to
make coffee-growing a basis for self-support. The
coffee the forestry officers had planted twenty years
before was growing finely, and was of the best
quality. As we did our own work, it would seem
an easy matter to secure our own support by this
coffee cultivation alone. There were other industries
projected also.</p>

<p>During all the months of the first rains the
health of our little colony was excellent. There
was not one but what received a toning up by the
cooler atmosphere, mountain air, and healthful
work. This was a great cheer to us all, and was
the first step toward making Thandaung known
favorably for a hill station.</p>

<p>Thandaung itself is a charming locality. The
mountain chain, or ranges, “Karen hills,” as they
are called, of which the ridge known as “Thandaung”
(iron mountain) is a part, cover a very
large area, running from the Malay peninsula to
China, and from fifty to one hundred and fifty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
miles wide. The highest elevations are nine or ten
thousand feet, but most of the ridges and plateaus
rise no higher than three to five thousand feet.
The scenery is magnificent and varied in character.
Looking westward from our school, the mountain
drops away at an angle of about fifty-five degrees
into a deep valley, down which the Pa Thi
Chang stream runs in a succession of cataracts.
Then the hills rise again, forming a vast amphitheater.
Standing on the site of our school, this
splendid view is constantly before us. Looking
beyond the lower hills, the view widens until the
whole of the Sitiang Valley, with its winding river
and broad lakes, light up the scenery with life.
Beyond this plain rise in succession three ranges
of the low Pegu Hills, the intervening valleys but
dimly defined, while beyond all these there is a
smoky depression indicating the great valley of
the Irrawaddy River. Beyond this again, on the
farthest horizon, are seen the rounded ridges of
the Arracan Hills, about one hundred and twenty
miles from Thandaung. In all this vast expanse
of mountain, valley, and plain there is not one
barren rood of earth. Mountains and plains, where
not recently cleared, are covered with a tropical
forest. Where there are cultivated fields, they are
matted with luxuriant green of growing rice, or
yellow with the ripened crop. This stretch of
deep-green verdure under a tropical sun throws on
the vision a combination of coloring that gives the
place a “charm all its own,” as one admiring visitor
declared. When the rains have washed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
atmosphere clear of dust, the view is very clear.
Houses in Tomgoo, twenty-three miles away, are
very clearly seen. The great oil-trees on the
plains, some specimens of which are left standing
where a great forest has been cut away, lift their
straight gray trunks a hundred and fifty feet to
the first limb, and above this hold a majestic crown.
Often have I seen, under the reflected rays of the
morning sun, those trunks of trees defined like so
many giant pencils. Yet they are twelve to fourteen
miles away. To the north and south the view
is over well-rounded hills and ridges for sixty to
seventy-five miles. But it is to the east we turn
for the sublimest scenery. A little over a mile
from the school a peak rises above the surrounding
heights. It is called Thandaung Ghyi, meaning
the greatest Thandaung. Climbing up the forest
path, and finally scaling a sharp and rocky height,
we stand on the top, only a rod across. From here
all the western view, also north and south, is taken.
Toward the east an entirely new arrangement of
the hills is made. From where you stand there is
a precipitous descent of nearly three thousand feet
into a basin fifty miles across, rimmed on the east
by a great ridge with a culminating peak called
Nattaung, or Spirit Mountain, nine thousand feet
high. The Bre Hills, where the wild Karens live,
join this ridge, and the two curve until they complete
the opposite border of the basin. Never have
I been able to look on the sublime ranges of mountains
and picturesque plains over this sweep of two
hundred miles of Burma’s varied surface, without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
a profound sense of awe and wonder. It is so
wonderful that it grows on one, though seen daily
for years.</p>

</figure>

<p>Once I went with a friend to Thandaung early
on a January morning. This is the season when
fogs hang heavily over the plains and reach high
up the mountain valleys; but our mountain heights
are above the fogs, in perpetual sunshine. When
we reached the top of Thandaung Ghyi an unexpected
view delighted our eyes. The great basin
to the east was filled with a dense fog, and we were
looking down upon it as it floated like a great gray
sea three thousand feet below. The lower mountains
here and there lifted above the fog, and their
wooded tops made beautiful islands in the sea of
vapor. The sun was shining from the opposite
side, and the full flood of reflected glory fell upon
our eyes.</p>

<p>At another time, accompanying a Government
official, I went up to get this view. The rains had
not yet ceased, but were dying away. We hoped
to reach the top before the daily storm came on.
We took this chance, as the views are the most
glorious after the rains have swept the sky of
every speck of dust. But the rains beat us, and
we were drenched, while the mountain was buried
in the clouds. After two hours we were growing
cold, and were about to give up the object for
which we came. Lingering a last moment, I
thought I saw a rift in the clouds, and then the
streak of light broadened, the rain grew less, the
darkness lifted, and a field of blue appeared, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
sun shone through the falling rain, and suddenly
all the basin below, and old Nattaung, rising above,
appeared to our entranced vision! All the heightened
coloring was intensified by our position under
the shadow of the retreating cloud. Eyes may
hardly hope to see a more wonderful vision of
mountain scenery than we beheld as this vision
was slowly borne from the rift in that retreating
storm.</p>

<p>Our new enterprise was planted under such
conditions and amid such scenes as these. While
it was a discouraging task, a daily view of the
mountains round about us drove away many an
occasion of low spirits. Taken all together, we
in time became a happy family, sharing a common
task. During this first monsoon our frail house
several times gave way in floor, roof, or wall; but
we suffered no serious harm. In September, as
the sun was occasionally breaking through the
clouds, and we were wondering what move we
would make for a better habitation, a telegram
came from Bishop Thoburn, which read, “God has
sent you a thousand dollars for a house.” If the
heavens had opened suddenly, and the money had
dropped into our upturned hands, it could hardly
have been more really a providential gift in our
extreme need. No wonder we all <em>rejoiced aloud</em>!
Later a letter came, telling us that a good woman
who had come from Scotland to India to visit missions,
and having brought considerable money with
her to give to mission institutions, had been in
conference with Bishop and Mrs. Thoburn, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
as a result of a canvass of all the many worthy
objects in which a great mission is fostering, she
chose this Thandaung school as the first to receive
her favor. She approved the undertaking, and
gave a thousand dollars to erect a building for the
school. No wonder the bishop could telegraph
that God had sent the help. This was only the
beginning of the beneficence of this good woman;
and the strange thing was that she had no acquaintance
with Methodists, and had been trained
in a Church of quite opposite teaching and polity
from ours.</p>

<p>The building of our first house deserves mention.
The logs were cut from the forest and
dragged to a sawpit and sawed by hand by Burmese
sawyers, in the old style of one man above
and one man under the log. This was slow and
crude work; but it was the only way to get building
material. The framework was built on posts
set in the ground, as has been the universal custom
in the construction of wooden houses in Burma.
The iron for the roof had to be brought from Rangoon
by rail to Tomgoo, and from there to the
mountain top, by carts and coolies. This pioneer
work took time and the most constant supervision.
The number and character of men that the missionary
has to work with, as well as the mixed
character of the population of Burma, may be
understood from the following account: I bought
the iron of a Scotchman, who imported it from
Germany. It was delivered to a Eurasian station
master, aided by a Bengali clerk. The railroad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
that carried it is owned by the Government, but
managed by the Rothschilds. The iron was delivered
at Tomgoo by a Eurasian station master,
aided by a Hindu clerk from Madras, and another
a Mohammedan from Upper India. A Tamil cart-man
carried it to the Sitiang River, where a Bengali
Mohammedan carried it over the ferry. A
Telegu cart man hauled it to the foot of the hills.
Shan coolies carried it up to Thandaung, where
Burmese carpenters put it on the house with nails
that I bought of a Chinaman, who had imported
them from America. The logs of the house had
been cut from the forest by Karens, and drawn to
the sawpit by a Siamese elephant! The missionary
had the simple duty of making all the connections
and keeping the iron moving to its destination.</p>

<p>But we were needing the new house badly before
we got it. Part of the roof was nailed on,
the frame completed, but only a very little of the
plank walls begun, when our old hut collapsed
entirely. We had often patched the rotting bamboos,
but as the monsoon passed away the east
wind, as usual on those hills, began to blow with
great force, and the frail walls repeatedly gave way
before it, and finally one morning the entire roof
and sides were blown away. A very wonderful
providence was manifested, in that no one of our
large family was hurt. Most of the smaller children
had been romping on the east side of the
house, and the gale of wind was blowing from the
east. In their play they suddenly ran down the
path fifty yards or so from the house. In that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
instant the roof and poles that held it down were
lifted and hurled upon the place where they had
been playing the moment before. The loose pieces
of corrugated iron cut the air like swords, and
some of them were carried far down the mountain
side, which falls in precipitous descent from that
point. Had the children not been moved away
for that moment by the unseen hand of God, they
must have been cruelly hurt. As it was they were
out of danger, while those of us that were in the
collapsed house suffered no harm. This is but
one of many indications which we had of the kindly
Providence in all our pioneering. For nearly three
years from the beginning of this work, there was
not a case of serious sickness nor an injury of
consequence by any accident suffered by any of
our little colony.</p>

<p>But as our old hut was gone beyond repair or
reconstruction, and as the wind was now cold, for
it was November, the matter of providing shelter
became a serious matter. The frame of our new
house was completed, and a part of the roof was
on, also a few planks nailed upright at one corner.
Taking this beginning as a starting, we inclosed
a part of the space of the building by bamboo
mats, laid a little flooring temporarily, and then,
having divided this into two rooms, we moved into
our new quarters. The workmen went right on
with the construction of the house. We lived in
the house while it was being builded. When completed,
though built of unseasoned wood, poorly
sawed and roughly put together, it was a palace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
compared with what we had before, and indeed it
continues to this day to do very good service.</p>

<figure id="i_283" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28em;">

    <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">First Permanent Building on Thandaung</span>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>About the time the house was completed, Miss
Bellingham, the generous donor of the thousand
dollars, came to Burma to see what use we had
made of the money. She spent a week on Thandaung,
to our great delight and hers. She consented
that the building might bear her name, and
we have since called it “Bellingham Home.”</p>

<p>Shortly after we began operations on this hill,
public interest in the place began to be shown. I
wrote some letters to the Rangoon papers, and
visitors did likewise. The advantages of the place
were laid before the Government. Officials began
to come up on tours of inspection. The place grew
in favor, and it was planned to give Government
sanction to making it into a station. A new road
up the mountain, giving a better grade than the
old road, and the cart road across the plain was
metalled. The old travelers’ bungalow on the
hill, that had fallen into decay since the military
left the place, was rebuilt. So the improvement
goes on till now. The latest plan contemplates
a cart road running entirely up the mountain, and
the survey of the whole hill into building sites.
There is every promise of this becoming the favorite
resort in Burma for the people who seek a
change from the heat of the plains.</p>

<p>In the meantime the scheme has had a good
degree of prosperity, in spite of the fact that it
was pioneer in character and location. The irresponsible
gossips continue to attack it, the fearful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
in heart who love their bondage to the old order
still stand agape as they see the school continue
on its way. The people who have been beating
their way through the world still cry it down. But
an increasing number of people who believe in self-dependence,
and the character it develops, are in
great sympathy with this work. Some who can
pay full boarding fees send their children to us.
They have adopted with us the theory that this
self-help is to be accepted as a necessary part of a
well-appointed system of education.</p>

<p>There has been a specially significant growth in
usefulness among the girls. They have learned
to bake excellent bread, cook and serve a variety
of food in a cleanly and orderly manner, and to
keep the entire house in good taste and comfort.
This is realized as a great accomplishment when
one has seen the slovenly, untidy houses commonly
found where the woman in the house does
not do anything to keep the house in order herself,
and counts it impossible that she should do
what she chooses to call “coolie’s work.” A
woman like this would not know enough even to
instruct good servants in keeping the house, much
less the worthless servants she can ill afford to
keep, whose only qualification is that they are as
incompetent as servants as their mistress is as
head of the establishment. Yet almost universally
such women would prefer to exist in a hovel, and
give orders to a miserable servant, rather than
have a decent abode, if they had to sweep, scrub,
or dust it with their own hands. In contrast to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
these are the girls trained in our industrial school.
They can do all things necessary to keeping a
house, and have almost forgotten that there are
any servants in the world. They have done all
this, and at the same time they have been in
school, doing as good work as girls in other
schools, where they depend on servants for even
buttoning their clothes.</p>

<p>Our girls are self-respecting young women, far
beyond what they could have been had they not
received the advantages in character that come
from self-help in ordinary daily tasks.</p>

<p>The boys have generally profited by the outdoor
work. Having nothing to begin with, it has
not been possible as yet to organize the outdoor
work as that within doors. Plans are under way,
however, to develop this branch of the school,
hoping for a large industrial plant.</p>

<p>Enough has been done in these four years
greatly to encourage those of us who have sacrificed
something in planning and carrying forward
this new feature of industrial mission work. There
is to-day more material advantage in this plant
than can be shown in any institution anywhere
that I have been for the money invested. More
has been done in direct school work, for the money
invested, than in almost all the English schools
with which I am acquainted. The effect of the
work on the boys and girls under our care has
exceeded our highest hopes. I am sure not one
of us would be willing to go back to the old order
of Orphanages. The boys and girls themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
do not want to return to the old order. The school
has met with a degree of favor from those whose
judgment is counted of the highest value to us, by
reason of the fact that they have put money into
the plant under the old order and the new also,
that we hardly dared to hope for. We have also
received a bequest of seventeen hundred dollars
with which we have put up a second building. The
patronage of the school by people of means and
social standing is such as to encourage us much.
It reveals the fact that the school meets a want
felt most by the people who make a financial success
of life, but see that self-help should be taught
to every child regardless of financial circumstances.
These people believe that indolence, dependence,
and slovenly habits are a disgrace, and honest work
in all things is honorable.</p>

<p>Miss Perkins, now in the eleventh year of her
continuous service on the field, has carried on this
work for more than a year, being aided by Miss
Rigby, who went to her aid in 1900.</p>

<p>This industrial school was founded to reteach
the truth long since forgotten in Asia that all kinds
of household and manual toil are respectable. The
Lord himself was a carpenter, and washed the feet
of his disciples, which many of those who bear his
name would be ashamed to do. The school has
run four years without a servant, and is stronger
than when it began. In this it is the only institution
among Europeans in all Asia that is so
managed. It is absolutely unique in this. It promises
much usefulness and a large growth. But if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
it were closed up to-morrow, it would still have
proved by four successful years that such a plan
is possible of successful operation even in Asia.</p>

<p>While it is not directly a part of mission enterprise,
it may be of interest to some reader to have
some account of experiences and observations in
a Burma forest. Some such experiences came to
me in connection with life on and about Thandaung.
Nearly the entire distance from Tomgoo
to Thandaung is through a forest reserve of the
Government. Several miles of this forest are made
up of the great trees before mentioned. One variety
produces an oil used in Europe for making
varnish. The method of extracting this oil is very
curious. A deep cut is made in the tree near the
ground, and in this cut a fire is built and kept burning
until the tree is blackened ten feet or more
from the ground. Then the coals are taken out
of the cut, which has become a sort of cup, into
which the oil oozes from the wound made by the
fire on the tender tree. It seems almost cruel to
treat the giant trees in this way. It is astonishing
that they survive and heal over the great blackened
scars left on their sides.</p>

<p>Another remarkable thing observed in these
forests is the growth of notable vines and parasites.
Here is to be seen a great vine, like half
a dozen grape-vines joined together, climbing high
round and into these splendid trees. The trunk
is usually not large, though so tall. Then high up
on this tree a spore of the peepul-tree finds a lodgment,
and sprouts, the leaf upward, the root running<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
downward, hugging close to the tree as if
drawing life from the trunk. Sometimes the young
growth starts a hundred feet from the ground.
As its main root descends it throws outside roots
which encircle the tree, and these roots branch
again so the whole trunk is soon inclosed in a
great net, ever tightening. Here is seen a very
strange thing. These roots do not overlap, but
grow right into each other when they come in contact,
and the union is made without a trace or scar.
As these meshes of the living net grow, they
tighten into a hug that kills, first the vine and
then the tree. Each in turn is devoured by the
great parasite. Its net meantime becomes a solid
wooden shell, reaching to the ground and lifting
its crown high among the other giants; a tree
made great by the death of two others; a tree and
vine, each seemingly having as much right to live
as this parasite that preys on other forest life.</p>

<p>Another singular circumstance annually occurs
in the forest. About the end of January a species
of great bees, as large as the American hornet,
come from migrations, nobody knows where, and
rest upon the under side of the branches in the
crowns of these great monarchs of the forest, which
sometimes rise two hundred feet from the ground.
About this time some varieties of these trees are
in heavy bloom, and no doubt it is this which
brings the bees. They locate on only one or two
kinds of trees, and at once begin to build honeycombs,
suspending them from the under side of
the limb. They multiply rapidly, and by March<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
there are sometimes as many as twenty to thirty
swarms on a tree. The honeycombs are sometimes
three feet long, and hang perpendicularly a
foot and a half. The study of these bees is very
interesting. They build on the same trees from
year to year.</p>

<p>But the most impressive fact is to observe the
method of collecting the honey. The trees are
perfectly smooth, and are often without a limb for
one hundred and fifty feet. The Karens usually
collect the honey, and the Burmese dealers come
to the camps to buy it when first secured, and
take much of it away to the towns. How do they
get the honey? The Karens climb up these bare
trunks. But how? Some of them are seven feet
thick, and can not be grasped in a man’s arms
so as to enable him to climb. The daring man
drives thin bamboo pegs into the bark of the tree,
and goes up on these. More, he drives in the pegs
as he climbs! They are about eight inches long
outside of the small portion imbedded in the bark,
and twenty-two inches apart. So the climber, beginning
at the ground, can only place two or three
pegs before he begins his ascent. In all this perilous
climb he never has the use of more than two
of these short projections at once. On these he
clings with feet and legs while he must use both
hands in driving a new one. To get the honey,
he must wait till night, and then with material for
a torch, a vessel for the honey, and a rope to lower
it, he climbs up into the darkness and out onto
the great branches, where with lighted torch he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
drives the bees away and cuts off the well-filled
honeycomb, and lowers it to others on the ground.
In this manner he takes all the honey from a tree.
A more daring feat for a small return can hardly
be imagined. And nerves of steadier poise are
required to prevent the destruction of the climber.
He receives a dollar and a half for clearing one
tree. Surely a life is regarded of little value among
these people.</p>

<span class="subhead">The Present Situation in Missions</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> first century of modern missions has
closed under circumstances of great encouragement,
not without its element of deep solicitude.
The last ten or fifteen years have brought
to the home Church the report of more triumphs
of the gospel than any like period since the days
of the apostles. All lands are open, or are being
opened, to the missionary. Converts are coming
by the tens of thousands annually into our mission
Churches, where even a quarter of a century ago
the same missions would have been content with
scores. Missionaries formerly had only those difficulties
to adjust which met the little band of converts,
while to-day they have the problem of the
rapidly-growing Church, so recently gathered out
of heathenism.</p>

<p>China has had an upheaval; but all missionaries
believe the future of the Chinese missions is bright
with hope. The martyrdom of the missionaries
and the Chinese converts has been as heroic as any
in Christian annals. Whatever the Chinaman may
or may not be generally, as a Christian he has
proven himself worthy. The persecuted young
Church will be worthy of the millions of converts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
that are to be gathered in when the country has
been settled again.</p>

<p>In Southern Asia there has been the famine,
far more terrible in its consequences than the mobs
and wars in China. But the famine has been
greatly relieved, and the impress of Christianity
and civilization relieving its worst distress has
been wholly good. Many thousands of converts
are presenting themselves to the Church. Baptisms
were discontinued in the famine districts
during the year of greatest distress. But since
the famine has ended, we hear of two conservative
brethren baptizing eighteen hundred in three days
in Gujarat, with the prospect of eight or ten thousand
others coming into the Christian community
after them in that district alone.</p>

<p>All over the vast Indian field people hitherto
counted difficult of access are ready to listen to
the gospel. The Burmese were counted, until recently,
so fortified in their Buddhism that they
could not be induced to accept the gospel; but we
find it is not so now. One missionary, new to the
field too, baptized more than one hundred last
year, and he might easily have added many more
if he had been properly supported. What could
not a mission, aggressive and large enough to have
momentum, do? It would be easy to add to the
young Church in Southern Asia, being gathered
by Methodism, twenty-five thousand converts annually,
if we could be re-enforced only slightly.
Yet, as it is, we must keep accessible people waiting
for years till we can receive them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span></p>

<p>There is just now an important movement
going on in far away Borneo, the Southern limit
of this vast field. There has recently been established
a colony of Chinese Christian immigrants
in the island. Bishop Warne visited them, and
placed a preacher in charge. They are immigrants
from Southern China. Other Christians will follow
these pioneers. They are in immediate contact
with the Dyaks, head hunters of the island,
and must have much to do in influencing and probably
beginning a work of conversion among these
savages of the Borneo jungle.</p>

<p>All eyes are upon the Philippine Islands, where
a new reformation appears to be going on. Thousands
of Catholics, who have never known the
comfort of a pure, simple faith, nor the joy of reading
the Word of God, are crying out for the full
gospel light. They are appealing to the Protestant
missionaries for instruction, and they are being led
to a purer faith.</p>

<p>All this array of current mission facts declares
that God is owning his messengers in every land;
that he is fairly crowding success on to the missionaries,
to cheer them and quicken the Church
in home lands into something of a true conception
of the magnitude and urgency of his plans for
giving the gospel to every creature, and to lift the
age-long night from the Christless nations.</p>

<p>Thus success of missions throws a great burden
of work and responsibility upon the missionaries at
the front. It can hardly be understood in America.
In the home land most pastors have Churches,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
the whole machinery of which has long been in
working order, and they pursue that work along
well-established lines. Their entire surroundings
are of, or are influenced by, the Christian Church,
and at least a Christianized civilization. The pastor
is not required to go outside of the well-known
methods of carrying on our Church work.</p>

<p>In the foreign field the contrary is the case.
The missionary is compelled to be a pioneer in
methods of work. He is against a living wall of
idolatrous humanity, and he often feels very sorely
the lack of human support and sympathy. He has
to carry the finances of the mission as well. Oftentimes
he is the only resource the mission enterprise
has. In the Methodist mission in Southern
Asia more property has been secured by the unaided
missionary than through Missionary Societies.
In addition to all the burdens of a surrounding
heathenism and of mission business, the
missionary has charge of more Church members
than the average pastor at home. In the Methodist
Episcopal Missions of Southern Asia the
members of Annual Conferences, including missionaries
and native members, have more than
twice as many Church members to care for, per
man, than the pastors at home, the average being
taken in both cases.</p>

<p>The greatest need of every mission with which
the writer is acquainted, and pre-eminently so in
the Methodist Episcopal Mission, is more well-equipped
missionaries. Yet this is exactly what
we can not get. We can only hope that we can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
maintain about the number of missionaries on the
whole field which we now have. This means if
there is any extension of the field so as to require
missionaries in new places, they must be thinned
out in the older parts of the mission. The Church
has candidates for the foreign field, but the Missionary
Society has no money to send them. Recently
some of the finest candidates have been refused
for the lack of money for their support,
while the missionaries on the field are fairly staggering
under the load they carry, hoping for delayed
re-enforcements, who do not arrive. The
disproportion of work actually in hand, to the men
and women who do that work, is most distressing.</p>

<p>There are great questions of missionary policy
to settle. A strong force of missionaries, adequately
superintended by men who are acquainted
with the work they superintend, is the least that
can be asked in our missions. A close and detailed
oversight of all mission interests, working
out a far-sighted policy, which changes only by
light that comes by actual experience in mission
work, is of the greatest value. It is clear this
superintendency can not be accomplished by periodical
visits of some official whose whole life has
been spent in the home field. A secretary or a
Mission Board is of little account in determining
the internal management in any far-distant field.
An occasional visit by some such official may do
incidental good in acquainting the missionaries
with the condition in the home Church, and in
bringing to the people at home fresh facts from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
field. But for administrative purposes on the field
such visits are of little or no value.</p>

<p>The Methodist Episcopal Missions in Southern
Asia have been most highly favored in thirteen
years of the missionary episcopacy, with Bishop
Thoburn to fill the office of superintendent and
leader. His administration is sure to become more
and more monumental as time reveals its scope
and character. It is now clear that no other episcopal
supervision hitherto provided by Methodism
is equal to this missionary episcopacy for the far-distant
mission fields.</p>

<p>The success of this policy and of Bishop Thoburn
in that office determines the question of the
future policy of the Church in the administration
of the mission field of Southern Asia. The General
Conference of 1900 by a decisive vote increased
the missionary episcopal force in this field,
and by an equally decisive vote elected Dr. E.&nbsp;W.
Parker and Dr. F.&nbsp;W. Warne to the missionary
episcopacy, and in co-ordinate authority with
Bishop Thoburn.</p>

<p>The election of Dr. Parker as bishop was a
general recognition of his long and pre-eminently
successful missionary career. The election of Dr.
Warne to a like office was in response to a like
choice of India, for this younger, but very efficient
missionary, whose pastorate and presiding eldership
in the city of Calcutta had been of such a
character as to make him well qualified for the
larger office to which he has been called. But one
year has passed since their election, and a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
change has come. Bishop Warne has been eminently
acceptable in his new office, and he has traveled
widely throughout the great field where Methodism
has its foothold in the southlands of Asia.
But Bishop Parker’s stalwart form has yielded,
after a prolonged battle with an obscure disease
which laid its hand upon him within a few months
after his election. His death demands a reverent
pause, while we drink in renewed inspiration from
reflection on his noble Christian manhood and
really pre-eminent service as a missionary.</p>

<p>Bishop Parker had labored over forty-two years
as a missionary to India, and it is a safe statement
that in this more than twoscore years he did more
work than any missionary in India of any Church,
or perhaps in any land, in the same time. The
work which he did in laying broad foundations,
winning men to Christ, calling into being valuable
mission agencies, and as a masterful, statesman-like
administration in the Church, has classified
him, from two separate and distinct sources, as
“the most successful missionary in India.” Every
element of his noble Christian manhood and eminent
ability measured up to the requirements of
this exceptional estimate of the missionary and
his work.</p>

<p>He has now ascended to his heavenly reward,
to be forever with the Lord and to share in his
glory. The cablegram that reached us in America
was brief, but laden with a great sorrow and a
greater triumph, “Parker translated!” We will no
more have his counsels, his inspiring presence, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
grasp of his strong hand, or hear his manly voice
in Indian Conferences. For this loss we weep.
He was “translated.” In this glad triumph we
are filled with joy. Death is abolished to such
a saintly follower of his Lord passing from mortal
vision.</p>

<p>Bishop Parker was ready for other worlds.
His recent testimony was triumphant, in keeping
with the godly life he lived. It was fitting that the
good bishop should take his departure from amidst
the glorious Indian hills he had loved so long.
His last days were spent in Naini Tal, amid the
most varied mountain scenery in India. Here lies
the lake of wonderful clearness, stretching for a
mile in length, filling the basin. Around the lake
is the mall, or broad road. From this road others
branch off, some circular and others zigzagging
up the mountains, which rise a thousand and more
feet above the lake, their sides clad from base to
top with, evergreen, pines, and oak. Here residences,
churches, and schools nestle among the
trees wherever space can be found. Here tired
missionaries go in May and June to rest from the
fiery heat of the plains below, and to gird themselves
anew with strength as they look upon God’s
mountains. From the northern ridge they look
upon the whole mountain amphitheater with its
glorious lake “shimmering” in the sunlight, high-rimmed
with its border of living green, while to the
north, stretching hundreds of miles to east and
west, rise the perpetually snow-covered Himalaya
mountains. The picture, one of nature’s wonders,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
has few equals for inspiring beauty and grandeur
combined. As the man looks through the
rare, clear, mountain air, on peaks and range resting
in quiet strength and majesty, he almost feels
as if he was in sight of the eternal hills where
God is.</p>

<p>Amid such scenes, with his brave wife by his
side, companion of his missionary labors about
him, and a host of God-fearing Christians all over
India, among whom were a multitude of the dusky
natives, waiting in sorrow because they “should see
his face no more,” the bishop was “translated.”
As his Lord on the Mount of Olivet took one
look upon his disciples, and then a cloud received
him and he ascended on high, so his servant was
translated from the hills of Naini Tal; was caught
up amid the clouds to be forever with his Lord.</p>

<p>So the workmen fall. Others labor on, but
they are overburdened. They must be re-enforced.
The young native Church must be shepherded.
Thousands of others will join the flock.</p>

<p>Just here we missionaries have our greatest
fear. We are the Church’s representatives. God
is with us, and the doors are all open. We have
done all that men and women can do. Will the
Church at home sustain us in the great and glorious
task that is appointed to us? This is our
only fear. So loyal and true are many of the
hearts at home to the cause of missions, that it
seems unkind to speak of any lack. Yet, while we
love every generous impulse of those who give
money and time to that which, as missionaries, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
give our lives and our loved ones, we love our
cause so much the more that we must be true to
its urgent needs and its perils for the want of a
little money.</p>

<p>That our advance is retarded over a vast area,
that many of our institutions are imperiled, that
native preachers are being dropped for the lack
of the small salary they require, and that we are
being compelled to ask of our Board to give up
a section of our India Church because missionary
appropriations are cut down, is but an outline of
our care at this time. To the home Church we
look for relief.</p>

<p>This relief can come only in one way. Our
people at home, in the most wonderful prosperity
America ever knew, are not increasing their gifts
to missions with their growth in wealth. Some
are, but most are not. The aggregate of all
moneys given by the Methodist Episcopal Church
for preaching the gospel in heathen lands is only
about twenty-two cents per member. This is all
that is given to declare Christ to the Christless
nations! Our people are giving about forty times
as much for their own religious instruction and
for the gospel in Christianized lands. This proportion
is distressing to the missionary who stands
among millions of people who have been waiting
nineteen centuries, and have never yet heard that
a Savior had been born into the world.</p>

<p>The writer is convinced that the measurable
failure to give to the cause of missions as our
people are able to give, is due to the failure to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
get the information to them in an effective way.
It is not the writer’s intention to locate the responsibility
or discuss a policy of raising missionary
funds, but clearly a virtual standstill in receipts
under present conditions is defeat for the missionary
cause.</p>

<p>One fact is certain, our present methods of raising
funds leaves the majority of our people without
feeling the immediate and imperative need of this
cause, or inspiring them with the certainty of gaining
a great result by the investment of money in
missions. We are in the second year of the
“Thank-offering” movement, and more than
eleven million dollars have been pledged toward
the “Thank-offering,” and certainly not nearly one
hundred thousand dollars of this amount has gone
to missions. Not one dollar in a hundred!</p>

<p>One chief reason why this disparity exists is
because all other causes have employed special
agencies to reach every nook and corner of the
Church, and the cause of missions is being operated
at long range and on general principles, often
as only one of the “benevolences,” and must necessarily
fail to advance to any considerable extent
under present conditions and absolute restrictions.</p>

<p>But there are hopeful indications. Some officials
and some pastors begin to see the situation
and to inquire what can be done to relieve the
straits. A number of loyal souls are tenderly giving
their most cherished treasures to the cause of
missions. In a year’s campaign at home I have
come in heart-touch with so many such that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
would gladly believe there is a multitude who
cherish the cause of missions as supreme, as it
really is.</p>

<p>The Mission Conference in Burma, little company
that it is, is being re-enforced by a promising
band of six missionaries, long overdue it is true,
but now gladly and gratefully received. Nearly
all of these are being sent by the sacrifice of people
who give largely of that which is a sacrifice to give.
One missionary family is being sent out and sustained
for a part of this year by more than fifteen
hundred dollars given by the preachers of the
Kansas and the St. Louis Conferences. This very
large giving of men of very small resources to a
special object that touched their hearts has put
new courage into all our little Burma Mission.
In this giving they have helped put true-hearted
missionaries in the field, and I believe permanently
enlarged their sympathy for missions, if indeed
they have not also indicated an improved policy
of raising mission funds.</p>

<p>The Woman’s Foreign Missionary Society,
through some of its young lady Auxiliaries, is
doing most generous things for the re-enforcements
to Burma.</p>

<p>Burma has waited long for even small re-enforcements,
and needs yet many other things before
it is fairly launched as a mission. But with
the re-enforcements we have now in immediate
prospect, we are so encouraged we can return to
our field and take up the work with renewed courage
and hope, knowing of the increased number of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
friends of missions who support us with money
and prayerful sympathy.</p>

<p>A hope I often cherished in times of great
weariness and discouragement seems in part being
realized. Many times in Rangoon, when wearied
to exhaustion with the work of two or three men,
I have gone up to the Sway Dagon Pagoda, and,
looking upon its gilded mass and the Burmans
chanting their meaningless laudations, I have
longed for heralds enough to bring these people
the gospel instead of Buddhism, and to replace the
pagodas of the land with Christian Churches;
longed for re-enforcements that came not. Then
I turned into the northeast corner of the pagoda
area and looked upon the graves of the British
officers who fell in the war of 1852 while storming
that pagoda. Then down the slope up which that
band of Anglo-Saxons charged, to the graves of
soldiers who were buried where they fell. My
blood warmed with the thought that these men
gave their lives without a word of complaint for
their queen whom they loved, and the flag which
they raised over this far-distant land, to the immense
benefit of the land of Burma. Then I remembered
that the world-wide empire of which
this is a part had been secured and maintained by
men who, as these, had laid down their lives for
the flag they loved.</p>

<p>From this scene and its suggestions I turned
away, encouraged to hold my post till re-enforcements
would come up for the preaching of the
gospel of the Son of God, who sent me to Burma.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
Here was a very human kind of encouragement.
Looking up the shining pagoda shaft I saw a
sprout of the peepul-tree, the sacred tree of Buddhism,
which grows anywhere on any surface
where its spores can find lodgment; which when
neglected has torn to fragments hundreds of pagodas,
here springing from the great pagoda two
hundred feet from the ground. It had found an
opening through the gold leaf, or perhaps had been
buried in the mortar with which its surface had
been plastered, and had sent its roots deep into the
brick mass of the pagoda; while its green branches
grew in a thriving cluster over the gilded sides.
What did it matter that this tree was two hundred
feet from the ground, and had no moisture save
what its roots could extract from the dry bricks
and its leaves draw out of the air! This peepul-tree
can thrive anywhere!</p>

<p>Beautiful symbolism! The gilded colossal pagoda
represents the lifeless system of hoary Buddhism.
The growing young tree represents the
religion of Jesus Christ, filled with the life of the
Son of God. It will crumble Buddhism back to
dust, as that tree, if fostered, will destroy the pagoda,
Buddhism’s most ornate symbol. Looking
on this scene, my heart took new courage, as
under Divinely-given cheer, to labor on for the salvation
of the Buddhists and other people of Burma.</p>

<p>When describing the pagoda and its surrounding,
at Adams, New York, I dwelt at some length
on the graves of the English soldiers there, and
spoke of their courage and self-sacrifice. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
was a large congregation present, nearly all of
whom were strangers to me. At the close of the
service I saw a little man start from the rear of
the church and make his way down the side aisle,
then across the church, and as he came he quickened
his step; and grasping my hand he exclaimed
with trembling voice: “I tried to come to church
this morning, having heard a man from Burma
was to speak; but I could not get here. I live
nine miles back in the Adirondacks, and I drove in
to-night to hear you. I am so glad those graves
of the English soldiers are cared for; I was in
the regiment that stormed that pagoda hill in
1852.” He wrung my hand and shed tears of gladness
because I came from Burma and brought
him a voice from the land of the stirring scenes of
his soldier life of forty-eight years ago.</p>

<p>There will be a day when every pagoda will
crumble down, every mosque and Hindu temple
fall into decay, and Christian churches stand in
their places, and Burma, as all other parts of this
needy world, will be fully redeemed. In a brighter
world there will be a time of rejoicing over the
gospel triumphs, and all who in person or by proxy
aided in the gospel victories in all the world, shall
strike glad hands, like the old soldier, and say, “I
was there and helped in the glorious work.”</p>

<span class="subhead">Benefits of British Rule in Southern Asia</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> missionary is one of the most interested
students of government that can be found.
Good or bad government affects his work vitally.
Not only does good government give him protection
from violence, but it gives settled peace
to the people among whom he preaches, and thus
provides the best conditions for the success of his
calling. He can not wait for good government
where it is not; but where he has the benefits of a
settled state of society that is protected by wholesome
laws promptly executed, he is one of the
first men to recognize the priceless benefits of such
government. Then he looks to the effect of government
on the general conditions of the people.
His views of government are not narrow. He
looks ahead to the final effect on the mass of the
people of the Government under which he lives.
From every standpoint the missionaries whose
fields lie under the British flag are best situated
of all men of like calling in foreign lands. It therefore
comes to pass that all missionaries, of whatever
nationality, living in Southern Asia are almost
a unit in praise of the Government. This Government,
which has for more than forty years given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
protection to life, calling, and property of its nearly
three hundred million diverse peoples, and that in
unbroken peace, deserves the highest approval of
all fair-minded men.</p>

<p>Life is as well protected in Southern Asia as
it is in almost any land. The highest in the land
and the meanest coolie are alike protected before
the law. Where any man thinks he can insult or
assault with even a little lordliness there is recourse
to the law, and that within reach of the
lowliest and the poorest, and he can get evenhanded
justice for any injury, and that quickly.
Perhaps in no land is the man of high and the man
of low degree dealt with with more evenhanded
and prompt justice than in Southern Asia. There
are many social distinctions made in Asia, most of
all in Southern Asia, peculiar to the land, and the
Government adds its official distinctions and social
ranks. But when it comes to the law and its administration
in protection against all oppression
and injustices, these social conditions have no
place. It appears to be true that in a Briton’s
mind there are two places where men of all stations
have equal rights—before a court, and at the
sacramental altar in the church. Every man is
protected in the exercise of his religious faith, and
must not be molested by any. To revile another’s
religion is to bring down the swift penalty of
the law.</p>

<p>It is possible for missionaries and other travelers
to come and go anywhere in the Indian Empire
without a thought as to their personal safety,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
as that is assured. Even unattended ladies make
long journeys, and with only native carriers, sometimes
travel in unfrequented regions and in the
darkness; but so far as I can learn, there has
not for many years been an insult offered to one
of them. Some of our own workers live and travel
in remote regions, even on the extreme borders of
the empire, and sometimes these are lone women;
but we do not hear of even serious inconveniences
to them on account of their isolation. This is due
chiefly to the Government, which protects life,
persons, and calling.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, not surprising that the missionaries
are among the most devoted supporters
of the British Government in Southern Asia. It
is likely they would support any Government
under which they would find themselves called to
work. They would teach their converts loyalty
and obedience to law. But it is a great gain to be
able to say to all the peoples of the Indian Empire
that the Government under which they find themselves
is one of the very best the world has produced.
And if it were necessary to say it, they
could truthfully add, better than any possible Government
by native rulers, better for themselves,
and better for all people in the land. It is a great
pleasure to American missionaries to acknowledge
the good government of India, for in it they find
many of the best principles in which they believe.
So far as I can learn, this just tribute from the
American missionaries is well nigh universal
among them, and the older they are and the longer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
they have lived in any part of this great empire,
the more confirmed they are in their views.</p>

<p>Of all the institutions of the Government that
are most to be commended, the courts are perhaps
the most notable. There are several features of
these courts which are specially commendable.
They are prompt to a degree. Long, vexatious
delays over technicalities of law are most unusual.
It is not infrequent that a serious breach of law
is brought to account very soon, and finally
settled. Certain it is that money and influence
and the “tricks of lawyers” can not long delay
final decision on any case. Then there is no crowding
to the wall the poor man without influence or
money to aid him. The poorest can sue as a
pauper, and have his case heard in regular order
with the rich man of high station. He can get as
certain justice, based on evidence. Cases are on
record in recent years to illustrate how the socially
high and even the official class have been rebuked
and punished at the plaint of the lowliest in
the land. They would be well worth recording
if their publication would not be understood as
too personal. It is this absolutely even-handed
justice that has called out the comment of the
native of India, “The English judge is not afraid
of the face of man.” No partiality is shown for
race or condition.</p>

<p>The system of Government seems to be well
worthy of study. There is the viceroy, and associated
with him, but not limiting his powers, a
Council representing the entire Empire. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
are lieutenant-governors over provinces. Then
there are chief commissioners over portions of the
country that are not regarded of sufficient importance
to have lieutenant-governors. Under
both these officials the next officers in rank are
commissioners over divisions, and these in turn
have deputy commissioners under them who administer
districts. Below the deputy commissioners
there are several lesser officers, usually over
townships, but having a wide range of duties.
From viceroy down to deputy commissioners the
officers have certain executive, or executive and
judicial powers combined. The higher officers
have also authority to some extent in military
affairs.</p>

<p>The army is made up of British troops and
native soldiers, with a great preponderance of the
latter. There are also many belonging to the
military police. The same division is made in the
civil police. The police department is perhaps
the most difficult branch of Government to keep
efficient and free from scandal, but there are many
worthy men in the police service.</p>

<p>In addition to the regular administrative officers
mentioned there are departmental officers,
such as an engineering corps, which has the care
of all public works. There is the growing educational
department and a medical department including
care of prisons, hospitals, and a great forestry
department, that conserves the valuable forests
of the empire. There is also a department of
marine with full official equipment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span></p>

<p>There is a civil service system operating
throughout all these departments of government,
including even the most subordinate clerkships.
The higher officials are usually brought out from
some part of Britain, and have been taken into
Government employ after the severest examinations.
Their promotions are given by grade and
service, allowing also for special promotions for
distinctive service. Having been so placed that I
have had to do with a wide range of these officials,
in most departments of the service, it becomes a
great pleasure to me to record the character of
their official conduct as I have found it in personal
dealing. In the first place, they almost without
exception are men of courteous, gentlemanly manners.
This alone goes far to smooth the way in
official transactions. Then I have found them generally
men who are very fair and even generous
in dealings where public interests, missionary matters,
or property have been dealt with. This is
partly due to the system of aid given especially to
schools with which both the Government and the
missionary have to do, and partly due to fair dealing
on general principles, which I am led to believe
from an experience all over the province of Burma
for a period of ten years, and from inquiries from
others of longer experience, is a British characteristic.
This is especially true of the better cultivated
men. The snobbery of the uneducated
Briton is equal to that of the American of the same
class. In the whole range of my experience I have
never met with other than manly treatment from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
officials but twice, and then these were not of the
higher ranks, and one of them can not be said to
be a Briton. If an officer might be disposed to
be unfair, he knows that there is a superior above
him that is ready to correct any abuse. But the
whole system of Indian service is well worth study,
for it is not a creation of a day, but the best fruit
of England’s extensive colonial experiences. In
this matter it is well worth study, especially on the
part of America, which has now to enter upon the
rule of large and distant possessions. It is also
to be noted that the wonder of England’s Government
is that she has been able to allow of a diversity
of Governments in her several possessions
suited largely to local conditions, so that no two
of her colonies are entirely alike, and yet she has
been able to give protection, justice, and the largest
measure of liberty to each country that the people
are able to utilize for their own good. In these
respects it is only fair to say her system of Government
over remote and diverse peoples is the
best yet seen on this globe.</p>

<p>There is also a striking feature of the Government
of municipalities in India. Municipalities
have not wholly self-government, yet they are so
ordered that the popular will has a representation,
even when it retards the actual progress of the city,
as it not infrequently does. The municipalities are
governed by commissioners, about half of whom
are elected by the people, and the other half are
appointed by Government. The latter are not
Government officers, however. They may be as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
democratic in their votes as any member of the
municipal committee. But these commissioners
are representative of the different native races, as
well as the Europeans in the city. In a city like
Rangoon there are several great race divisions
that are recognized on the municipal committee,
both elective and appointive. In the election of
these commissioners appears one of the most extreme
examples of the democratic principles that
the writer knows of anywhere. Perhaps it has no
parallel. In the case of the ballot, it is allowed
freely to <em>all Europeans and Americans</em> on exactly
the same conditions. They, as aliens, never having
become British subjects, and never intending to do
so, <em>have the ballot the same as an Englishman</em>. This
broad democracy has greatly surprised many
Americans when I have told them of it. The alien
has a right to hold the office of city commissioner,
if elected, the peer of the native-born Briton.
This is the broadest democracy found anywhere
within the defined limits of franchise.</p>

<p>The Government has a vast system of railroads
in India amounting to sixteen thousand miles, with
many other extensions and new lines in prospect.
These roads now reach nearly all the districts
which could sustain them. They are sometimes
built for military purposes, but they are mostly
directed for the carrying of traffic in times of peace.
The province of Burma, one of the later provinces
to be thoroughly developed, is having railroads to
all its principal sections, and some of these roads
are being projected to the very borders. That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
to Kunlon is extended to the borders of China.
They also talk of a line from Rangoon through
Western China, and there is every likelihood of
connections direct with Bengal. So the old world
moves under the impetus of Western enterprise.
The telegraphs attend the railway, and exist even
far outside of railway lines to all parts of the empire
and to foreign lands. Let it be remembered
that probably none of these improvements would
have been thought of in the country had not it
been taken in hand by an enlightened and enterprising
people from the West.</p>

<p>Great systems of canals have been constructed,
and more than thirty million acres of land are irrigated,
and famine in this area is forever forestalled.
Larger plans are being suggested by the recent
famine. The famine relief works constructed many
tanks on land too high for irrigation from running
streams.</p>

<p>Good pavements in cities and good roads have
been made in the land universally. These roads
are nearly all metaled and kept in good order.</p>

<p>Public buildings of the most substantial and
imposing kind are built in all capital cities. The
Government wisely erects buildings in keeping
with its own governmental ideas, and with its declared
intention of remaining in the land to work
out its plans. The public parks and gardens are
on an elaborate scale, and are enjoyed by everybody.
The memorials to great men of India and
the great men who have made India British territory
are placed in all public gardens. Great men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
and great deeds are set before the world as they
should be, that the world may emulate them. The
latest design is to build a memorial to Queen Victoria
in the city of Calcutta, to which many of the
rajahs of India are subscribing. The building is
to cost perhaps more than five million dollars, and
while it is a great memorial to Queen Victoria, it
is to be a museum of great men of India as well.
There will be other memorials established in other
cities of the Indian Empire also. The taxes of
the Government are reasonable. They are mostly
placed directly on the earning power of the individual,
or tax upon land assessed in proportion to
the amount of grain it produces, There is also a
tax on houses in villages outside municipalities.
The land tax is very just. If the land produces
regular good crops, it is taxed accordingly. If
there is a failure of crops, the tax is reduced or
remitted. As land needs rest, it is allowed a tax
at fallow rates, which is very light indeed. The
income tax is collected chiefly in cities, but of all
Government employees, beginning with the viceroy.
This tax is two per cent per month. This is
to be paid out of the monthly salary. But it is said
this tax only reaches one out of three hundred and
fifty of the native-born inhabitants of India.</p>

<p>The Government claims to own the land, very
much as the American Government owns the public
lands. But, of course, the greater part of this
land comes into the ownership of the people, and
is transferable as elsewhere in the world. In the
comparatively rich province of Burma, where there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
has been until recently much of the very best land
of the tropical world lying idle, grown into grass
and forests—land that never was cultivated, the
land is given out freely to would-be cultivators.
They only have to show that they are prepared
to cultivate it. They have to pay nothing but for
its survey. When it is cultivated they get a title
to it, and then they can sell it as the actual owners.
If it is grass land, the cultivators are allowed one
year exemption from tax. If forest land, ten years
are allowed exemption. A more liberal plan could
not be devised than this. It is just here that England’s
policy in the country is shown. If a Burman
asks for a piece of land, and a European, any Englishman
indeed, asks for the same piece of land,
the Burman will surely get it. One becomes more
and more convinced that the policy of Government
in India is to govern for the best interests
of the Government. There is another great plan
of Government to aid agriculture. The people
of all parts of the Indian Empire are chiefly agricultural.
They are like all Asiatics, great borrowers
of money. They generally mortgage the
crop by the time it springs out of the soil. The
native money-lender demands as much as three
per cent a month; but here the Government comes
forward, and agrees to loan the agriculturalist
money at six per cent a year, and allow him to
repay it in partial payments. This is eminently
fair, and any man can get it who can show that he
can repay it, and can give two personal securities.
This seems a very liberal proposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span></p>

<p>The Government has also devised a great school
system to aid in popular education. The schools
of Southern Asia have been almost entirely in the
hands of the various religions of the land. The
Government has undertaken to work out a plan
by which a very large part of this education can
be put under popular control, and yet be allowed
to remain under the direction of the various religious
communities that conduct schools. Of course,
under the old order there was but a small part of
the community allowed to go to school, and the
teaching was of an inferior kind. Government
would promote education and give a fixed standard.
To do this they had to put the secular instruction
of all schools under the Government, and
allow the religious instruction to be carried out
according to the ideas of every society concerned.
So that we witness Mohammedan, Christian,
Hindu, and Buddhist schools, all drawing aid from
Government, and all passing the same Government
examinations in secular subjects, but each
imparting its own religious instructions. To aid
in this educational scheme, the Government will
give grants in putting up buildings, in paying accredited
teachers, and in giving grants to current
expenses on passes secured in Government examinations.
In addition, the Government has built
up certain schools entirely under its control, where
no religion is taught.</p>

<p>In all this it will be seen that the Government,
in keeping with its declared purpose and position,
is neutral in the matter of religion. It ought to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
clear to all who will see it, that the Christian
Church should avail itself of all this educational
plan that is possible, so as to mold the minds of all
the young in Christian principles. Nearly all mission
schools are identified with this educational
system, but there is opportunity for much more
of the same kind of work.</p>

<p>There is another great and merciful arm of
Government to be mentioned. In every municipality,
and even in large villages, there is hospital
treatment for all who need medical or surgical
aid. All this is freely given to every applicant.</p>

<p>All cities and large towns have great hospitals
where medicines and food and shelter in bad cases
are given freely to men of all races and creeds.
No disease is turned away, and no sick man denied
attention. This charitable effort of Government
is far-reaching in its beneficence. It is not so
valuable as it might be, because it has a prejudice
of the populace to deal with. But the amount of
suffering that is relieved by Government in all the
empire is enormous.</p>

<p>In cases of epidemics there is a Government
order to fight the disease in an organized way. If
it is smallpox, which is very prevalent, public vaccination
is enforced. Cholera epidemics are taken
in hand vigorously, water purified, and quarantine
established, until the pestilence is put under control.</p>

<p>The last four years has called out all the agencies
of a great Government to battle with the
Bubonic plague and the famine. It is now more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
than four years since the plague began its ravages
in India, and a little over three years since the
famine began its course of devastation. Both of
these dire visitations were grappled with from the
start, and the battle is still being waged.</p>

<p>A competent board of physicians and a large
force of skilled nurses were quickly organized, and
they have been unremitting in their efforts, and
many of these have fallen victims to their difficult
and dangerous duty. A system of inspection was
at once established on all railroads and steamship
lines throughout India and along its coasts. Every
traveler, irrespective of race or rank, has been examined
by medical experts. Yet in spite of this
precaution the deadly scourge has insidiously
worked its way almost throughout the empire.
But still the Government grapples with the pestilence.
One can feel something of its terrors when
it is noted that ninety-four per cent of all who are
seized by the plague die. Six hundred thousand
have died of the plague in five years. The greatest
hostility has been shown at times by the native
population, in opposing the most necessary plague
regulations.</p>

<p>With plague almost all over the empire, the
Government had at the same time to undertake
a most extensive plan for relieving a famine that
was ever undertaken by any Government in human
history. The famine had only one immediate
cause—the lack of rain. The greater rains over
almost all India occur between June and September.
For years on overlapping territory the rains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
failed, or were deficient. The world knows the
story. One-fourth of the nearly three hundred
millions of this population of the empire were
in the terrors of famine, with its slow starvation
of man and beast, with its attendant cholera,
plague, and other diseases. It is worthy of cordial
recognition and perpetual memory that this gigantic
specter was met by a Christian Government.
It was not a Mohammedan or Hindu people which
fought back this monster calamity, but a Government
and a people whose sympathies were Christian.
The Christians hurried to the relief of those
of non-Christian belief and alien people, and hardly
thought of their race or religion. They only knew
they were starving communities of fellow-beings,
and they put forth supreme efforts to relieve their
hunger and other ills due to the famine. Yes, this
was done by a Christian Government, aided by
private Christian beneficence of distant lands, while
their own co-religionists, having money in many
cases, owning nearly all the grain in the empire,
enough to have fed all the hungry at every stage
of the famine, gave practically nothing for famine
relief! They held their feasts, organized their tiger
hunts, looked on the dance of the impure nautch-girl,
and reveled while their people starved and
died, or owed their life to a foreign race of the
Christian faith.</p>

<p>The Government of India spent $92,650,000 on
famine relief during 1899 and 1900. The relief
works were open nearly two years before that, and
help on a large scale continues still. This is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
most gigantic effort of all human history to meet
a great national calamity. Strange that these
noble and statesman-like efforts should have been
belittled by any, much less by some who should
have known better.</p>

<p>The census of 1901 has been gathered, and
these columns of figures tell their sad story of
suffering and death in the famine districts. Of
India’s two hundred and eighty-six millions of ten
years ago, sixty-six millions were residents in
native-protected States. The census of 1901 shows
that British India increased its population by ten
millions, while the peoples of the native States decreased
three millions. British territory increased
its population by four and one-half per cent, and
the-native States decreased by four and one-half
per cent.</p>

<p>A close inspection of the figures shows the decrease
to be largely due to the famine. What
would have been the death-rate but for the English
Government’s immense relief?</p>

<p>The missionaries worked hand in hand with
the British officers, and I have never heard that
either has ever spoken except in words of praise
of the other’s labors. This proves that good Governments
and faithful missionaries are invaluable
to each other.</p>

<p>A crowning proof of the good government of
Britain in India, is in the fact that her population
does not migrate to any adjacent State where
there is limited or unlimited native rule. But from
all such States there is a steady stream of immigration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
pouring into British territory. None of
India’s peoples migrate in any numbers to any
Oriental or Occidental country, but from every
Oriental land there are immigrants to sojourn or
to settle in India under the justice, protection, and
peace of British rule.</p>

<p>The tropical world is fast coming under Western
domination. These lands must be lifted by
new blood from the North and West, and must
serve the needs of our race. While this process
is going on, the world can afford to be happy over
the fact that so large a part of the tropical countries
is under British rule.</p>
